    bio: "Elizabeth Greene is a transformational leader, workforce development pioneer, and social entrepreneur who has dedicated her career to creating pathways out of poverty and into prosperity. As Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Elevate for Humanity Technical & Career Institute, she has built one of Indiana's most innovative and compliant workforce development organizations—serving justice-involved individuals, low-income families, and barrier-facing populations with dignity, excellence, and measurable results.\n\nUnder Elizabeth's visionary leadership, Elevate for Humanity has achieved unprecedented recognition and approval from federal, state, and local agencies. The organization is a U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) Registered Apprenticeship Sponsor (RAPIDS ID: 2025-IN-132301), approved by the Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD) as an INTraining provider (Location ID: 10004621), and recognized by the Indiana Department of Education (DOE). All programs are eligible for WIOA, Workforce Ready Grant (WRG), and Justice Reinvestment Initiative (JRI) funding—making training 100% free for qualified students.\n\nElizabeth's accomplishments extend far beyond credentials. She has created a fully integrated ecosystem that combines workforce training, apprenticeship programs, case management, mental health support, housing assistance, and employer partnerships—all designed to address the root causes of poverty and recidivism. Her holistic approach recognizes that career success requires more than skills training; it requires wraparound support, trauma-informed care, and genuine human connection.\n\nA master strategist and systems builder, Elizabeth has navigated complex federal and state compliance requirements to position Elevate for Humanity as a trusted partner to WorkOne Centers, EmployIndy, community corrections, reentry programs, and employers across Indiana. She has secured state licensing board approvals for cosmetology and barber programs, established partnerships with healthcare facilities for clinical training, and created apprenticeship pathways in skilled trades—all while maintaining the highest standards of quality and accountability.\n\nElizabeth's leadership philosophy is rooted in equity, empowerment, and excellence. She believes that every person—regardless of their past—deserves access to quality education, living-wage employment, and the opportunity to build a better future. Her work is driven by a simple but powerful conviction: when you invest in people, you transform communities.\n\nBeyond her role at Elevate for Humanity, Elizabeth is a sought-after speaker, consultant, and advocate for workforce innovation and second-chance hiring. She has advised nonprofits, government agencies, and philanthropic organizations on best practices for serving justice-involved populations, building compliant training programs, and creating sustainable pathways to economic mobility.\n\nElizabeth holds expertise in federal workforce policy, apprenticeship development, nonprofit management, compliance and accreditation, trauma-informed care, and social entrepreneurship. Her ability to envision what a community needs—and then build it with precision, integrity, and compassion—has made her a respected leader in workforce development and social impact.\n\nHer impact is measured not just in credentials earned or jobs secured, but in lives transformed, families stabilized, and communities strengthened. Elizabeth Greene is proof that one person with vision, determination, and heart can change the trajectory of hundreds of lives—and she's just getting started.",
