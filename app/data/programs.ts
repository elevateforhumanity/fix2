      "## The Day Indiana Changed Everything for Aspiring Barbers\n\n**March 14, 2024.** That's the day Governor Eric Holcomb signed House Bill 1135 into law. Then on March 21, 2025, House Bill 1320 followed. Together, these two pieces of legislation did something revolutionary: they officially recognized federally registered apprenticeships as a valid pathway to becoming a licensed barber in Indiana.\n\nBefore this, if you wanted to be a barber in Indiana, you had one option: pay $25,000 for barber school, sit in a classroom for 1,500 hours, and graduate with debt and zero clients.\n\nNow, there's a second path. And it changes everything.\n\n---\n\n## Marcus's Story: From Warehouse Worker to Licensed Barber\n\nMarcus was 28, working third shift at a warehouse on the west side of Indianapolis. $12/hour. No benefits. No future. He'd been cutting his friends' hair since high school—fades, tapers, lineups. People always told him he was good. But barber school cost $25,000. He had rent to pay. A daughter to support. He couldn't afford to quit his job and go to school.\n\nThen his cousin told him about the apprenticeship.\n\n\"I thought it was a scam,\" Marcus says. \"Get paid to learn? No tuition? I figured there had to be a catch.\"\n\nThere wasn't.\n\nMarcus applied in June 2024. Within three weeks, he was matched with MDG Salons on the east side. He interviewed with the owner. They clicked. Two weeks later, Marcus clocked in for his first day.\n\n**Week 1:** Marcus was nervous. He watched the other barbers work. He swept hair. He learned how the shop ran. He practiced on mannequins in the back. He earned $10/hour for every hour he was there.\n\n**Month 3:** Marcus did his first real cut. A simple taper. His hands shook. His mentor stood right behind him, coaching him through every step. The customer tipped him $5. Marcus felt like he'd just won the lottery.\n\n**Month 6:** A customer walked in and asked for Marcus by name. That's when it hit him: he was building something real. He was earning commissions now. His paychecks were getting bigger.\n\n**Month 12:** Marcus had 15 regular clients. Guys who only wanted him. He was doing fades, beard work, hot towel shaves. He was working more independently. His mentor still checked his work, but Marcus was getting it right most of the time.\n\n**Month 17:** Marcus passed his state board exam on the first try. He became a Registered Barber in Indiana. His regulars congratulated him. He decided to rent his own chair at the shop—$250/week. He kept 100% of his earnings after rent.\n\nToday, Marcus makes $55,000 a year. He has 30+ regular clients. He's saving to open his own shop in two years. And he graduated with zero debt.\n\n\"I walk into work every day and I'm excited,\" Marcus says. \"I'm building something that's mine. This program gave me a shot I never thought I'd have.\"\n\n---\n\n## How Indiana's Apprenticeship Program Actually Works\n\n### The Legal Framework\n\nIndiana's barbering apprenticeship is registered with the **U.S. Department of Labor** under the National Apprenticeship Act. It's a structured, 2,000-hour program that meets all requirements set by the **Indiana State Board of Barber Examiners**.\n\n**Key legislation:**\n- **House Bill 1135 (2024):** Established registered apprenticeships as a pathway to licensure\n- **House Bill 1320 (2025):** Expanded apprenticeship opportunities and clarified requirements\n- **Indiana Code 25-7-5:** Governs barber licensing and apprenticeship standards\n\n**Program registration:**\n- Registered with U.S. Department of Labor\n- Approved by Indiana State Board of Barber Examiners\n- Meets federal apprenticeship standards (29 CFR Part 29)\n- Complies with Indiana Professional Licensing Agency requirements\n\n### The Requirements (Straight from Indiana Law)\n\n**To enter the program, you must:**\n- Be at least 17 years old (Indiana Code 25-7-5-7)\n- Have a high school diploma or GED\n- Pass a background check (required by participating shops)\n- Have reliable transportation to your shop placement\n- Be eligible to work in the United States\n\n**To complete the program, you must:**\n- Complete 2,000 hours of on-the-job training in a registered barbershop\n- Complete 144 hours of Related Technical Instruction (RTI)\n- Pass the Indiana State Board of Barber Examiners practical and written exam\n- Pay licensing fees (approximately $85 total)\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Working 40 hours/week: 50 weeks for on-the-job hours\n- Plus 144 hours of theory (3-4 hours/week over the same period)\n- Total time: 15-17 months to complete all requirements\n\n---\n\n## Here's Exactly How \"Earn While You Learn\" Works\n\n**You work at a barbershop. They pay you. You're an employee, not a student.**\n\nHere's your typical week:\n\n### Your Weekly Schedule\n\n**Monday-Friday: Work at the Barbershop (40 hours/week)**\n- You clock in at your assigned barbershop\n- You work with real clients under supervision\n- You earn $10/hour base pay\n- You earn commissions on every service you provide\n- You keep 100% of your tips\n- **Weekly earnings: $400 base + commissions + tips**\n\n**Plus: Online Theory Classes (3-4 hours/week)**\n- Complete online coursework in the evenings or weekends\n- Learn barbering theory, sanitation, business skills\n- 144 total hours spread over 15-17 months\n- **This is your \"school\" component—but it's flexible and online**\n\n### The Math\n\n**Total hours needed:** 2,000 hours on-the-job + 144 hours theory = 2,144 hours total\n\n**Working 40 hours/week at the shop:**\n- 2,000 hours ÷ 40 hours/week = 50 weeks (about 12-13 months)\n- Plus 144 hours of theory (3-4 hours/week over the same period)\n- **Total time: 15-17 months to complete everything**\n\n**What you earn while training:**\n- Base pay: 2,000 hours × $10/hour = **$20,000**\n- Commissions: Varies by skill level and clientele (starts small, grows over time)\n- Tips: Typically 15-20% of service price\n- **Total earnings during training: $20,000-$30,000+**\n\n### What the State/Funding Covers\n\n**The state does NOT pay your wages. Your employer does.**\n\n**What funding covers:**\n- Your training curriculum (Related Technical Instruction)\n- Career counseling and job placement support\n- Connections to participating barbershops\n- Support services (if eligible for WIOA/JRI)\n\n**What your employer pays:**\n- Your hourly wages ($10/hour to start)\n- Commissions on services you provide\n- You also keep tips from satisfied clients\n\n### The Hybrid Model Explained (And Why You Can't Do This on Your Own)\n\n**IMPORTANT: You CANNOT complete this program independently.**\n\nSome people think they can just work at any barbershop, take online classes, and get their license. **That's not how Indiana's apprenticeship program works.**\n\nHere's what's required by Indiana law and federal apprenticeship standards:\n\n#### You MUST Be in a Registered Apprenticeship Program\n\n**What this means:**\n- You must work at a **federally approved apprenticeship sponsor shop**\n- Your employer must be registered with the U.S. Department of Labor\n- Your shop must meet strict training standards and have approved mentors\n- Your hours must be tracked and verified by the apprenticeship sponsor\n- You must have a signed apprenticeship agreement\n\n**You cannot:**\n- Work at any random barbershop and count those hours\n- Take online classes on your own and call it an apprenticeship\n- Train yourself or learn from unlicensed barbers\n- Skip the registered apprenticeship and go straight to the state exam\n\n**Why these rules exist:**\nIndiana State Board of Barber Examiners requires proof that you completed a structured, supervised training program. Random work experience doesn't count.\n\n#### The Two Components (Both Are Required)\n\n**Component 1: On-the-Job Training (2,000 hours)**\n- **Where:** At your registered apprenticeship sponsor shop ONLY\n- **What:** Hands-on work with real clients under licensed barber supervision\n- **Tracked by:** Your employer and apprenticeship sponsor\n- **Verified by:** Monthly hour logs submitted to Indiana State Board\n- **You earn:** $10/hour base pay + commissions + tips\n\n**Component 2: Related Technical Instruction (144 hours)**\n- **Where:** Online or in-person classes provided by your apprenticeship sponsor\n- **What:** Theory, sanitation, Indiana laws, business skills, exam prep\n- **Schedule:** 3-4 hours/week, flexible (evenings/weekends)\n- **Tracked by:** Your apprenticeship sponsor\n- **Verified by:** Completion certificates submitted to Indiana State Board\n\n#### How Hours Are Tracked and Verified\n\n**Every week, you must:**\n1. Clock in/out at your registered shop (time tracking system)\n2. Have your mentor sign off on your work\n3. Submit hour logs to your apprenticeship sponsor\n\n**Every month, your sponsor submits:**\n1. Your verified hours to the Indiana State Board\n2. Progress reports on your skill development\n3. Completion records for theory coursework\n\n**When you're ready to test:**\n1. Your sponsor certifies you've completed 2,000 OJT hours + 144 theory hours\n2. Indiana State Board reviews your records\n3. You're approved to sit for the state exam\n\n**If you try to do this on your own:**\n- Your hours won't be verified or accepted\n- You won't be eligible to sit for the state exam\n- You won't get a barber license\n\n#### Current Approved Apprenticeship Sponsors in Indiana\n\n**As of 2025, these shops are federally approved:**\n- MDG Salons (Indianapolis area)\n- Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (Indianapolis area)\n- Additional shops being added regularly\n\n**We help connect you with approved shops.** You cannot just walk into any barbershop and start an apprenticeship.\n\n#### The Bottom Line\n\n**This is a structured, regulated program.** You must:\n- Work at a registered apprenticeship sponsor shop\n- Have a signed apprenticeship agreement\n- Complete 2,000 verified hours under licensed supervision\n- Complete 144 hours of approved theory instruction\n- Have all hours tracked and submitted to Indiana State Board\n\n**You're not sitting in a classroom all day, but you're also not doing this alone.** You're working a real job (40 hours/week at the shop) and taking a few hours of online classes each week—all within a registered apprenticeship program that meets Indiana and federal standards.\n\n---\n\n## How You Can Get This Training 100% Free\n\n**IMPORTANT: Understanding What Funding Covers vs. What Your Employer Pays**\n\nThe apprenticeship has TWO parts:\n1. **Part 1: Related Technical Instruction (RTI)** - 144 hours of theory/classroom\n2. **Part 2: On-the-Job Training (OJT)** - 2,000 hours working at the barbershop\n\n**Funding (WIOA, WRG, JRI) ONLY pays for Part 1 (the RTI curriculum).**\n\n**Your employer pays you for Part 2 (the hands-on work at the shop).**\n\nLet me break this down clearly:\n\n---\n\n### Funding Options Available\n\n**Option 1: WIOA (Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act)**\n- For low-income adults, dislocated workers, youth ages 16-24\n- Covers RTI curriculum cost\n- Apply through Indiana Career Connect at [IndianaCareerConnect.com](https://www.indianacareerconnect.com)\n\n**Option 2: Workforce Ready Grant (WRG)**\n- For Indiana residents pursuing high-demand careers\n- Covers RTI curriculum cost\n- Apply through your local WorkOne office at [WorkOne.in.gov](https://www.in.gov/dwd/workone/)\n\n**Option 3: JRI (Justice Reinvestment Initiative)**\n- For justice-involved individuals reentering the workforce\n- Covers RTI curriculum cost plus wraparound support services\n- Apply through your probation officer, parole officer, or reentry program coordinator\n\n**Option 4: Employer Sponsorship**\n- For anyone hired by a participating barbershop\n- Employer covers RTI curriculum cost\n- Get hired by a participating shop (we help with this)\n\n**Option 5: Self-Pay**\n- Payment plans available\n- Start immediately without waiting for funding approval\n\n---\n\n## How Funding Works\n\n**What funding covers:**\n- Your training curriculum (Related Technical Instruction)\n- Career counseling and job placement support\n- Connections to participating barbershops\n\n**What your employer pays:**\n- Your hourly wages ($10/hour to start)\n- Commissions on services you provide\n- You also keep tips from satisfied clients\n\n**You earn money while you train.

Here's how they're different:**\n\n---\n\n### Apprenticeship (What This Program Is)\n\n**Definition:**\nA structured, registered training program that combines on-the-job training with classroom instruction, leading to a recognized credential or license.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- ✅ Registered with U.S. Department of Labor\n- ✅ Approved by Indiana State Board\n- ✅ You're an EMPLOYEE earning wages\n- ✅ Structured curriculum with specific hour requirements\n- ✅ Supervised by licensed professional\n- ✅ Leads to professional license (Indiana Registered Barber)\n- ✅ Hours count toward state licensure requirement\n- ✅ Typically 1-4 years duration\n- ✅ Earn while you learn\n\n**Barber Apprenticeship specifics:**\n- 2,000 hours on-the-job training\n- 144 hours classroom instruction\n- Earn $10/hour + commissions + tips\n- 15-17 months duration\n- Graduate with license and $20,000-$30,000 earned\n\n**Legal protections:**\n- Minimum wage guaranteed\n- Workers' compensation coverage\n- Unemployment insurance eligibility\n- OSHA workplace protections\n- Cannot be fired without cause\n\n---\n\n### Internship (What This Is NOT)\n\n**Definition:**\nA temporary work experience, usually for students, to gain exposure to a profession. May be paid or unpaid.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- ❌ NOT registered with Department of Labor\n- ❌ NOT approved by State Board\n- ❌ Often UNPAID or low pay\n- ❌ No structured curriculum\n- ❌ May not be supervised by licensed professional\n- ❌ Does NOT lead to license\n- ❌ Hours do NOT count toward licensure\n- ❌ Typically 3-6 months duration\n- ❌ Often for college credit, not career\n\n**Example: Barbershop internship (hypothetical):**\n- Work at barbershop for 3 months\n- Observe and assist licensed barbers\n- Earn $0 or minimum wage\n- No formal training plan\n- Hours don't count toward barber license\n- Just for experience, not licensure\n\n**Legal status:**\n- May be unpaid (if meets certain criteria)\n- Limited legal protections\n- Not covered by workers' comp (usually)\n- Can be terminated at any time\n\n**Why internships don't work for barbering:**\n- ❌ You need 2,000 verified hours for license\n- ❌ Internship hours don't count\n- ❌ You'd waste time and earn nothing\n- ❌ Still need to complete full apprenticeship or barber school\n\n---\n\n### On-the-Job Training (OJT) - What This Is NOT\n\n**Definition:**\nInformal training provided by an employer to teach job-specific skills. Not registered or structured.\n\n**Key characteristics:**\n- ❌ NOT registered with Department of Labor\n- ❌ NOT approved by State Board\n- ❌ Employer decides training (no formal curriculum)\n- ❌ May or may not be supervised\n- ❌ Does NOT lead to license\n- ❌ Hours do NOT count toward licensure\n- ❌ Duration varies (days to months)\n- ❌ Just to learn the job, not get licensed\n\n**Example: Barbershop OJT (hypothetical):**\n- Get hired at barbershop as \"barber assistant\"\n- Learn by watching and helping\n- Earn minimum wage\n- No formal training plan\n- Hours don't count toward barber license\n- Cannot legally cut hair (not licensed)\n\n**Legal status:**\n- You're an employee\n- Earn at least minimum wage\n- Workers' comp coverage\n- But hours don't count toward licensure\n\n**Why OJT doesn't work for barbering:**\n- ❌ Indiana law requires formal apprenticeship or barber school\n- ❌ OJT hours don't count toward 2,000-hour requirement\n- ❌ You cannot legally cut hair without license\n- ❌ You'd be working illegally if you cut hair\n\n---\n\n### Side-by-Side Comparison\n\n| Feature | Apprenticeship | Internship | OJT |\n|---------|---------------|-----------|-----|\n| **Registered Program** | Yes (U.S. DOL) | No | No |\n| **State Board Approved** | Yes | No | No |\n| **Structured Curriculum** | Yes (2,000 hrs + 144 hrs) | No | No |\n| **Paid** | Yes ($10/hr + commissions) | Maybe (often unpaid) | Yes (minimum wage) |\n| **Leads to License** | Yes | No | No |\n| **Hours Count Toward License** | Yes | No | No |\n| **Supervised by Licensed Pro** | Yes (required) | Maybe | Maybe |\n| **Duration** | 15-17 months | 3-6 months | Varies |\n| **Legal Protections** | Full employee rights | Limited | Employee rights |\n| **Earnings During Training** | $20,000-$30,000 | $0-$5,000 | $5,000-$15,000 |\n| **After Completion** | Licensed barber | No credential | No credential |\n\n---\n\n### Why Apprenticeship Is the Best Option for Barbering\n\n**Compared to internship:**\n- ✅ You earn real money ($20,000-$30,000)\n- ✅ Your hours count toward license\n- ✅ You get structured training\n- ✅ You graduate with a license\n- ✅ You have legal protections\n\n**Compared to OJT:**\n- ✅ Your hours count toward license\n- ✅ You follow approved curriculum\n- ✅ You're supervised by licensed barber\n- ✅ You graduate with a license\n- ✅ You can legally practice barbering\n\n**Compared to barber school:**\n- ✅ You earn money instead of paying tuition\n- ✅ You work with real clients from day one\n- ✅ You graduate with clientele\n- ✅ You have 500 more hours of experience (2,000 vs. 1,500)\n- ✅ You graduate debt-free\n\n---\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n\n**Misconception 1: \"I can just work at a barbershop and count those hours toward my license.\"**\n\n❌ **Wrong.** Only hours in a registered apprenticeship program count. Random work at a barbershop doesn't count.\n\n**Misconception 2: \"An internship at a barbershop will help me get licensed faster.\"**\n\n❌ **Wrong.** Internship hours don't count toward licensure. You'd waste time.\n\n**Misconception 3: \"OJT is the same as apprenticeship.\"**\n\n❌ **Wrong.** OJT is informal training. Apprenticeship is a registered, structured program leading to licensure.\n\n**Misconception 4: \"I can do an unpaid apprenticeship to save the shop money.\"**\n\n❌ **Wrong.** Registered apprenticeships MUST pay at least minimum wage. Unpaid apprenticeships are illegal.\n\n**Misconception 5: \"Any barbershop can hire me as an apprentice.\"**\n\n❌ **Wrong.** Only registered apprenticeship sponsor shops can hire apprentices. Random shops cannot.\n\n---\n\n### How to Verify You're in a Real Apprenticeship\n\n**Ask these questions:**\n\n1. **\"Is this shop a registered apprenticeship sponsor with the U.S. Department of Labor?\"**\n   - ✅ Yes = Real apprenticeship\n   - ❌ No = Not a real apprenticeship (hours won't count)\n\n2. **\"Will my hours count toward my Indiana barber license?\"**\n   - ✅ Yes = Real apprenticeship\n   - ❌ No = Internship or OJT (hours won't count)\n\n3. **\"Will I be paid at least minimum wage plus commissions?\"**\n   - ✅ Yes = Real apprenticeship\n   - ❌ No = Likely illegal or not a real apprenticeship\n\n4. **\"Will I complete 2,000 hours of OJT and 144 hours of RTI?\"**\n   - ✅ Yes = Real apprenticeship\n   - ❌ No = Not following Indiana requirements\n\n5. **\"Will the Indiana State Board verify my hours?\"**\n   - ✅ Yes = Real apprenticeship\n   - ❌ No = Hours won't count toward license\n\n**If the answer to ANY of these is \"no\" or \"I don't know,\" it's NOT a registered apprenticeship.**\n\n---\n\n### Red Flags: Not a Real Apprenticeship\n\n**Watch out for:**\n\n❌ Shop says \"We'll train you, but we're not registered\"\n- Your hours won't count toward license\n\n❌ Shop says \"This is an unpaid internship\"\n- Illegal for registered apprenticeships\n\n❌ Shop says \"You'll learn on the job\" but has no formal training plan\n- Not a registered apprenticeship, just OJT\n\n❌ Shop says \"We don't report hours to the State Board\"\n- Your hours won't count toward license\n\n❌ Shop says \"You can start cutting hair right away without supervision\"\n- Illegal and dangerous\n\n❌ Shop says \"We'll pay you under the table\"\n- Illegal, no legal protections, hours won't count\n\n**If you see these red flags, walk away. Contact us to find a legitimate registered apprenticeship.**\n\n---\n\n### The Bottom Line\n\n**Barber Apprenticeship (This Program):**\n- ✅ Registered with U.S. Department of Labor\n- ✅ Approved by Indiana State Board\n- ✅ You're an employee earning $10/hour + commissions + tips\n- ✅ 2,000 hours OJT + 144 hours RTI\n- ✅ Hours count toward Indiana barber license\n- ✅ Graduate with license and $20,000-$30,000 earned\n\n**Internship or OJT:**\n- ❌ Not registered\n- ❌ Not approved by State Board\n- ❌ Hours don't count toward license\n- ❌ Waste of time for barbering career\n\n**Don't confuse them. Make sure you're in a REAL registered apprenticeship.**\n\n**Contact us to verify a shop is a registered apprenticeship sponsor:**\n- Email: elevate4humanityedu@gmail.com\n- Phone: (317) 314-3757\n\n---\n\n## What Happens If You Don't Complete Your Apprenticeship?\n\n### If You Stop Attending or Quit\n\n**Your hours are NOT lost. They're saved.**\n\n**What happens to your hours:**\n- ✅ All verified hours remain on record with Indiana State Board\n- ✅ Hours are permanently documented in your apprenticeship file\n- ✅ You can return to complete your apprenticeship later\n- ✅ Hours never expire (they're valid indefinitely)\n- ✅ You can transfer to a different registered shop\n\n**Example:**\n- You complete 1,200 hours at Shop A\n- You quit or stop attending\n- Your 1,200 hours are saved\n- 6 months later, you're ready to return\n- You need 800 more hours to reach 2,000\n- You can start at Shop B and complete remaining 800 hours\n\n**Important:**\n- ❌ You cannot practice barbering without completing all requirements\n- ❌ You cannot take state board exam until you complete 2,000 hours + 144 RTI\n- ❌ Your partial hours don't give you any legal right to cut hair\n- ✅ But your hours are saved and waiting for you\n\n---\n\n### If the Shop Closes or Loses Sponsor Status\n\n**Your hours are protected.**\n\n**What happens:**\n1. Shop notifies State Board they're closing or ending apprenticeship program\n2. State Board contacts you about your hour status\n3. Your completed hours are verified and saved\n4. We help you find a new registered apprenticeship sponsor shop\n5. You transfer to new shop and continue from where you left off\n\n**Example:**\n- You complete 1,500 hours at Shop A\n- Shop A closes permanently\n- Your 1,500 hours are verified and saved by State Board\n- You transfer to Shop B\n- You complete remaining 500 hours at Shop B\n- You graduate with 2,000 total hours\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Shop closure to new placement: 2-4 weeks\n- No gap in your hour count\n- New shop picks up where old shop left off\n\n---\n\n### If You're Fired or Terminated\n\n**Your hours are still saved, but circumstances matter.**\n\n**If you're fired for cause (your fault):**\n- ✅ Your completed hours are still saved\n- ✅ You can transfer to another shop\n- ❌ But finding a new shop may be harder (background check)\n- ❌ New shop will ask why you were terminated\n\n**Reasons for termination (your fault):**\n- Excessive absences or tardiness\n- Insubordination or unprofessional behavior\n- Theft or dishonesty\n- Substance abuse at work\n- Violating shop policies\n- Poor performance despite coaching\n\n**If you're fired without cause (not your fault):**\n- ✅ Your hours are saved\n- ✅ Easier to find new shop\n- ✅ We help advocate for you\n\n**Reasons for termination (not your fault):**\n- Shop downsizing or financial issues\n- Personality conflict with owner\n- Shop changing business model\n- Mentor leaving and no replacement\n\n**What to do if terminated:**\n1. Request written documentation of your hours from shop\n2. Contact State Board to verify your hours are on record\n3. Contact us immediately for help finding new placement\n4. Be honest with new shops about what happened\n5. Show you've learned from the experience\n\n---\n\n### Transferring to a Different Shop During Your Apprenticeship\n\n**Yes, you can transfer. Your hours go with you.**\n\n**Reasons you might transfer:**\n- Better opportunity at different shop\n- Moving to different city\n- Personality conflict with current shop\n- Better pay or commission at different shop\n- Current shop not providing good training\n- Closer to your home\n\n**How to transfer:**\n\n**Step 1: Find New Registered Apprenticeship Sponsor Shop**\n- Must be registered with U.S. Department of Labor\n- Must be approved by Indiana State Board\n- We can help you find approved shops\n\n**Step 2: Get Hired by New Shop**\n- Interview with new shop owner\n- Explain your situation honestly\n- Provide documentation of hours completed\n- New shop agrees to hire you as apprentice\n\n**Step 3: Notify Current Shop (If Still Employed)**\n- Give 2 weeks notice (professional courtesy)\n- Request written documentation of your hours\n- Get copy of all hour verification forms\n- Leave on good terms if possible\n\n**Step 4: Transfer Documentation**\n- Current shop submits final hour verification to State Board\n- State Board verifies your completed hours\n- New shop registers you as their apprentice\n- State Board transfers your file to new shop\n\n**Step 5: Continue Training at New Shop**\n- New shop picks up where old shop left off\n- You continue accumulating hours toward 2,000\n- New shop tracks and reports your hours\n- You complete remaining hours and RTI\n\n**Timeline:**\n- Finding new shop: 1-4 weeks\n- Transfer paperwork: 1-2 weeks\n- Starting at new shop: 1-2 weeks\n- **Total: 3-8 weeks**\n\n**Example:**\n- You complete 900 hours at Shop A\n- You transfer to Shop B\n- Shop B verifies your 900 hours with State Board\n- You complete 1,100 more hours at Shop B\n- You graduate with 2,000 total hours (900 + 1,100)\n\n---\n\n### Can You Work at Multiple Shops?\n\n**No. You can only be registered with ONE shop at a time.**\n\n**Why:**\n- State Board tracks your hours by shop\n- Only one shop can be your official apprenticeship sponsor\n- Prevents double-counting of hours\n- Ensures proper supervision\n\n**What you CANNOT do:**\n- ❌ Work at Shop A Monday-Wednesday\n- ❌ Work at Shop B Thursday-Saturday\n- ❌ Count hours from both shops\n\n**What you CAN do:**\n- ✅ Complete some hours at Shop A\n- ✅ Transfer to Shop B\n- ✅ Complete remaining hours at Shop B\n- ✅ Both sets of hours count (sequential, not simultaneous)\n\n---\n\n### What If You Stop and Start Multiple Times?\n\n**Your hours accumulate over time. No expiration.**\n\n**Example: Stop-and-start apprentice**\n\n**Year 1:**\n- Complete 600 hours at Shop A\n- Life happens, you stop\n- Hours saved: 600\n\n**Year 2:**\n- Return to apprenticeship at Shop B\n- Complete 800 hours\n- Total hours saved: 1,400 (600 + 800)\n- You stop again\n\n**Year 3:**\n- Return to apprenticeship at Shop C\n- Complete 600 hours\n- Total hours: 2,000 (600 + 800 + 600)\n- You complete apprenticeship and get licensed\n\n**This is allowed. Your hours never expire.**\n\n**However:**\n- ⚠️ Taking long breaks delays your career\n- ⚠️ Skills may get rusty if you're away too long\n- ⚠️ Finding shops willing to hire stop-and-start apprentices may be harder\n- ⚠️ Better to complete continuously if possible\n\n---\n\n### What If You Complete Hours But Not RTI (or Vice Versa)?\n\n**You need BOTH to be eligible for state exam.**\n\n**Scenario 1: Completed 2,000 OJT hours but only 100 RTI hours**\n- ❌ Not eligible for state exam yet\n- ✅ Your 2,000 OJT hours are saved\n- ✅ Complete remaining 44 RTI hours\n- ✅ Then eligible for exam\n\n**Scenario 2: Completed 144 RTI hours but only 1,500 OJT hours**\n- ❌ Not eligible for state exam yet\n- ✅ Your 144 RTI hours are saved\n- ✅ Complete remaining 500 OJT hours\n- ✅ Then eligible for exam\n\n**Both requirements must be met:**\n- 2,000 OJT hours (at registered shop)\n- 144 RTI hours (approved curriculum)\n- Both verified by State Board\n\n---\n\n### State Board Guidelines on Incomplete Apprenticeships\n\n**Indiana State Board policy (820 IAC 2-2-4):**\n\n**Hour preservation:**\n- ✅ All verified hours are permanently recorded\n- ✅ Hours remain valid indefinitely\n- ✅ No expiration date on apprenticeship hours\n- ✅ Apprentice can return at any time to complete\n\n**Transfer requirements:**\n- ✅ Apprentice must notify State Board of transfer\n- ✅ Previous shop must submit final hour verification\n- ✅ New shop must register apprentice\n- ✅ State Board transfers apprentice file\n- ✅ New shop continues tracking from previous total\n\n**Inactive apprentices:**\n- If you don't work for 12+ months, you're considered \"inactive\"\n- Your hours are still saved\n- You must notify State Board when you return\n- You may need to demonstrate retained skills\n- New shop may require refresher training\n\n**Shop responsibilities when apprentice leaves:**\n- ✅ Must submit final hour verification within 30 days\n- ✅ Must provide apprentice with copy of hour records\n- ✅ Must notify State Board of apprentice departure\n- ✅ Cannot withhold hour documentation\n\n**Apprentice rights:**\n- ✅ You own your hours (they're yours)\n- ✅ Shop cannot take away your hours\n- ✅ You can request hour verification at any time\n- ✅ State Board will provide your hour records upon request\n\n---\n\n### How to Protect Your Hours\n\n**Keep your own records:**\n- ✅ Take photos of weekly hour logs\n- ✅ Keep copies of monthly verification forms\n- ✅ Track your own hours in a notebook or app\n- ✅ Save all documentation from your shop\n\n**Request documentation regularly:**\n- ✅ Ask for copy of monthly reports submitted to State Board\n- ✅ Request hour verification every 3-6 months\n- ✅ Keep these in a safe place\n\n**If you're leaving a shop:**\n- ✅ Request written documentation of all hours completed\n- ✅ Get shop owner's signature on hour verification\n- ✅ Contact State Board to verify hours are on record\n- ✅ Keep copies of everything\n\n**If shop refuses to provide documentation:**\n- ✅ Contact State Board immediately: (317) 234-3040\n- ✅ State Board will investigate\n- ✅ State Board has records of all submitted monthly reports\n- ✅ Shop can be penalized for withholding documentation\n\n---\n\n### FAQs: Incomplete Apprenticeships and Transfers\n\n**\"I completed 1,000 hours but haven't worked in 2 years.

Federal Labor Laws (FLSA)**\n- Fair Labor Standards Act limits excessive work hours\n- Overtime pay required over 40 hours/week\n- Prevents employer exploitation\n\n**2. State Board Policy**\n- Indiana State Board wants quality training, not rushed hours\n- Apprentices need time to practice, reflect, and develop skills\n- Burnout leads to poor learning and safety issues\n\n**3. Employer Costs**\n- Overtime pay (1.5x wage) is expensive\n- Most shops won't allow more than 50 hours/week\n- Not cost-effective for employer\n\n**4. Practical Limitations**\n- Shops aren't open 24/7\n- You need time for RTI coursework\n- You need rest and recovery\n\n**If you try to work more:**\n- Shop may not report hours over 50/week\n- State Board may reject excessive hours\n- Risk of burnout and poor performance\n\n---\n\n## Fastest Possible Completion Time\n\n**Absolute fastest (working maximum hours):**\n\n**Scenario: 50 hours/week OJT + accelerated RTI**\n- 2,000 OJT hours ÷ 50 hours/week = 40 weeks\n- 144 RTI hours completed in 4 months (intensive program)\n- **Total: 10-11 months minimum**\n\n**Realistic fastest:**\n- Accounting for holidays, sick days, shop closures\n- **12-14 months** working maximum hours\n\n**You CANNOT complete faster than 10-11 months, even working maximum hours every week.**\n\n---\n\n## State Board Verification of Hours\n\n**State Board reviews your hours to ensure compliance:**\n\n**They check:**\n- ✅ Are you working reasonable hours per week? (20-50 hours)\n- ✅ Are hours consistent and verified?\n- ✅ Is employer paying overtime for hours over 40/week?\n- ✅ Are you completing RTI alongside OJT?\n- ✅ Is training quality maintained?\n\n**Red flags that trigger review:**\n- ❌ Claiming 60-70 hours/week consistently\n- ❌ Completing 2,000 hours in less than 10 months\n- ❌ No RTI hours reported\n- ❌ Inconsistent hour reporting\n\n**If State Board finds issues:**\n- May reject some hours\n- May require additional training\n- May investigate shop for violations\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Schedule for Success\n\n**Our recommendation for most apprentices:**\n\n**Standard full-time schedule:**\n- 40 hours/week OJT (Monday-Friday, 8 hours/day)\n- 3-4 hours/week RTI (evenings or Saturday)\n- **Total: 43-44 hours/week**\n- **Completion: 15-17 months**\n\n**Why this works best:**\n- ✅ Sustainable pace\n- ✅ Time to develop skills properly\n- ✅ Work-life balance maintained\n- ✅ No overtime costs for employer\n- ✅ Consistent learning and practice\n- ✅ Lower burnout risk\n\n**You'll earn $20,000-$30,000 over 15-17 months and graduate with solid skills and clientele.**\n\n---\n\n## Part-Time vs Full-Time: Your Schedule Options\n\n### Can You Do Part-Time Hours?\n\n**Yes! You can complete the apprenticeship part-time.**\n\n**Part-time options:**\n\n**Option 1: 20 hours/week**\n- Work 3-4 days per week at shop\n- Complete in 24-26 months (2+ years)\n- Earn $200-$400/week\n\n**Option 2: 25 hours/week**\n- Work 3-4 days per week at shop\n- Complete in 18-20 months\n- Earn $250-$500/week\n\n**Option 3: 30 hours/week**\n- Work 4-5 days per week at shop\n- Complete in 15-18 months\n- Earn $300-$600/week\n\n**Who part-time works for:**\n- ✅ Parents with childcare responsibilities\n- ✅ People working another job to pay bills\n- ✅ Students in school\n- ✅ Those with health limitations\n- ✅ Anyone who can't commit to full-time\n\n**Challenges with part-time:**\n- ⚠️ Takes longer to complete (2+ years vs 15-17 months)\n- ⚠️ Slower skill development (less practice)\n- ⚠️ Harder to build clientele (fewer days in shop)\n- ⚠️ Lower income during training\n- ⚠️ Some shops prefer full-time apprentices\n\n---\n\n### Can You Make Your Own Schedule?\n\n**No. Your employer (the barbershop) sets your schedule.**\n\n**How scheduling works:**\n\n**Employer determines:**\n- ✅ Which days you work (Monday-Friday, Tuesday-Saturday, etc.)\n- ✅ What hours you work (9am-5pm, 10am-6pm, etc.)\n- ✅ How many hours per week (20, 30, 40, or 50)\n- ✅ Whether you work weekends\n- ✅ Your days off\n\n**You can negotiate:**\n- ✅ Part-time vs full-time\n- ✅ Specific days off (for childcare, school, etc.)\n- ✅ Start/end times (within reason)\n- ✅ Flexibility for emergencies\n\n**You CANNOT:**\n- ❌ Come and go as you please\n- ❌ Set your own hours each week\n- ❌ Work only when you feel like it\n- ❌ Skip days without permission\n\n**Why employer controls schedule:**\n- You're an employee, not self-employed\n- Shop needs consistent coverage\n- Clients need reliable service\n- Training requires regular practice\n- State Board requires documented hours\n\n**Example schedules:**\n\n**Full-time schedule (40 hours/week):**\n- Monday-Friday: 9am-5pm (8 hours/day)\n- Weekends: Off\n- Total: 40 hours/week\n\n**Part-time schedule (25 hours/week):**\n- Tuesday-Thursday: 10am-5pm (7 hours/day)\n- Saturday: 9am-2pm (5 hours)\n- Total: 26 hours/week\n\n**Weekend schedule (30 hours/week):**\n- Thursday-Saturday: 10am-8pm (10 hours/day)\n- Total: 30 hours/week\n\n---\n\n### Are Theory Hours (RTI) Mandatory Every Week?\n\n**Yes, but there's flexibility in HOW you complete them.**\n\n**RTI (Related Technical Instruction) requirements:**\n- **Total required:** 144 hours\n- **Must be completed:** Before you can take state board exam\n- **Typical pace:** 3-4 hours/week over 12-15 months\n- **Can be accelerated:** Yes, complete faster if you want\n\n---\n\n### RTI Schedule Options\n\n**Option 1: Weekly Schedule (Most Common)**\n\n**How it works:**\n- Complete 3-4 hours of RTI every week\n- Spread over 48 weeks (12 months)\n- Steady, consistent pace\n\n**Example:**\n- Monday-Friday: Work at shop (40 hours OJT)\n- Saturday morning: 3 hours RTI online\n- Total: 43 hours/week\n\n**Pros:**\n- ✅ Manageable pace\n- ✅ Better retention of information\n- ✅ Doesn't interfere with work schedule\n- ✅ Less overwhelming\n\n**Cons:**\n- ⚠️ Takes full 12 months to complete RTI\n- ⚠️ Must be disciplined every week\n\n---\n\n**Option 2: Accelerated Schedule**\n\n**How it works:**\n- Complete 8-10 hours of RTI per week\n- Finish 144 hours in 15-18 weeks (4 months)\n- Intensive but faster\n\n**Example:**\n- Monday-Friday: Work at shop (40 hours OJT)\n- Saturday: 8 hours RTI\n- Sunday: 2 hours RTI\n- Total: 50 hours/week for 4 months\n\n**Pros:**\n- ✅ Finish RTI quickly\n- ✅ Then focus solely on OJT\n- ✅ Complete apprenticeship faster overall\n\n**Cons:**\n- ⚠️ Very demanding for 4 months\n- ⚠️ Risk of information overload\n- ⚠️ Less time for family/rest\n\n---\n\n**Option 3: Flexible/Self-Paced Schedule**\n\n**How it works:**\n- Complete RTI hours on your own schedule\n- Some weeks 5 hours, some weeks 1 hour\n- As long as you finish 144 hours before completing OJT\n\n**Example:**\n- Busy weeks: 1-2 hours RTI\n- Slow weeks: 6-8 hours RTI\n- Average: 3-4 hours/week over 12 months\n\n**Pros:**\n- ✅ Maximum flexibility\n- ✅ Work around your life\n- ✅ No strict weekly requirement\n\n**Cons:**\n- ⚠️ Easy to fall behind\n- ⚠️ Requires self-discipline\n- ⚠️ May delay completion\n\n---\n\n**Option 4: Front-Loaded Schedule**\n\n**How it works:**\n- Complete all 144 RTI hours BEFORE starting OJT\n- Intensive 3-4 week course\n- Then focus solely on shop work\n\n**Example:**\n- Weeks 1-4: 36 hours/week RTI = 144 hours total\n- Months 2-17: 40 hours/week OJT only\n\n**Pros:**\n- ✅ Get theory out of the way first\n- ✅ Then focus 100% on practical skills\n- ✅ No juggling work and school\n\n**Cons:**\n- ⚠️ Very intensive for 3-4 weeks\n- ⚠️ Not earning money during RTI period\n- ⚠️ May forget theory by time you finish OJT\n\n---\n\n### Can You Skip RTI Weeks?\n\n**Yes, but you must complete all 144 hours eventually.**\n\n**What's allowed:**\n- ✅ Skip weeks when you're busy\n- ✅ Take breaks from RTI\n- ✅ Complete hours at your own pace\n- ✅ Catch up later\n\n**What's NOT allowed:**\n- ❌ Skip RTI entirely\n- ❌ Take state exam without completing 144 hours\n- ❌ Count shop work as RTI hours\n- ❌ Fake RTI completion\n\n**Example:**\n- Week 1-10: Complete 3 hours/week RTI = 30 hours\n- Week 11-15: Skip RTI (busy at work)\n- Week 16-25: Complete 5 hours/week RTI = 50 hours\n- Week 26-30: Skip RTI (family emergency)\n- Week 31-50: Complete 3 hours/week RTI = 60 hours\n- **Total: 140 hours, need 4 more**\n- Week 51: Complete final 4 hours\n- **Total: 144 hours complete**\n\n**State Board only cares that you complete 144 hours total, not when or how.**\n\n---\n\n### Do You Have to Do RTI and OJT at the Same Time?\n\n**No. You have options.**\n\n**Option A: Simultaneous (Most Common)**\n- Work at shop 40 hours/week (OJT)\n- Complete RTI 3 hours/week\n- Both happen at same time over 15-17 months\n\n**Option B: RTI First, Then OJT**\n- Complete all 144 RTI hours in 3-4 weeks\n- Then start working at shop for 2,000 OJT hours\n- Total time: 13-15 months\n\n**Option C: OJT First, Then RTI**\n- Work at shop full-time for 12 months (2,000 hours)\n- Then complete 144 RTI hours in 4-6 weeks\n- Total time: 13-14 months\n\n**Option D: Mixed Schedule**\n- Complete some RTI, then some OJT, then more RTI\n- Flexible based on your life\n- Total time: 15-20 months\n\n**State Board allows any of these approaches as long as you complete both requirements.**\n\n---\n\n## Real-World Schedule Examples\n\n### Example 1: Full-Time Apprentice with Family\n\n**Marcus's schedule:**\n- Monday-Friday: 9am-5pm at shop (40 hours OJT)\n- Saturday morning: 3 hours RTI online while kids watch cartoons\n- Sunday: Family time, no work\n- **Total: 43 hours/week**\n- **Completion: 16 months**\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Consistent schedule\n- Weekends mostly free\n- Manageable pace\n- Time for family\n\n---\n\n### Example 2: Part-Time Apprentice with Another Job\n\n**Sarah's schedule:**\n- Monday-Wednesday: 10am-5pm at shop (21 hours OJT)\n- Thursday-Friday: Work other job to pay bills\n- Saturday: 4 hours RTI online\n- Sunday: Off\n- **Total: 25 hours/week**\n- **Completion: 24 months**\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Can keep other job\n- Still making progress\n- Flexible schedule\n- Sustainable long-term\n\n---\n\n### Example 3: Accelerated Apprentice\n\n**DeAndre's schedule:**\n- Monday-Saturday: 8am-6pm at shop (50 hours OJT)\n- Sunday: 8 hours RTI online\n- **Total: 58 hours/week for 12 months**\n- **Completion: 12 months**\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Wants to finish fast\n- No family obligations\n- High energy and motivation\n- Earning maximum money\n\n---\n\n### Example 4: Student Apprentice\n\n**Tasha's schedule:**\n- Monday, Wednesday, Friday: 2pm-8pm at shop (18 hours OJT)\n- Tuesday, Thursday: College classes\n- Saturday: 10am-6pm at shop (8 hours OJT)\n- Sunday: 4 hours RTI online\n- **Total: 30 hours/week**\n- **Completion: 20 months**\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Can finish college degree\n- Still progressing toward barber license\n- Flexible schedule\n- Building two careers\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways: Schedule Flexibility\n\n**What you CAN control:**\n- ✅ Part-time vs full-time (negotiate with employer)\n- ✅ When you complete RTI hours (flexible)\n- ✅ How fast you complete RTI (3 hours/week or 10 hours/week)\n- ✅ Whether you do RTI and OJT simultaneously or separately\n\n**What you CANNOT control:**\n- ❌ Your work schedule at the shop (employer decides)\n- ❌ Coming and going as you please\n- ❌ Skipping RTI entirely\n- ❌ Working more than 50 hours/week\n\n**Bottom line:**\n- You have flexibility in HOW you complete the program\n- But you must complete 2,000 OJT + 144 RTI\n- Your employer controls your work schedule\n- RTI can be done on your own time\n- Part-time is allowed but takes longer\n\n**Talk to potential employers about schedule flexibility before accepting apprenticeship position.**\n\n---\n\n## Facility Requirements for Apprenticeship Program Holders\n\n### Barbershop Facility Requirements (Indiana

screen every apprentice for WOTC eligibility!**\n\n**What the shop owner does NOT pay for:**\n- ❌ RTI curriculum (WIOA/WRG/JRI pays sponsor directly)\n- ❌ Registration fees (FREE)\n- ❌ State Board fees (FREE)\n- ❌ Apprentice's tools (shop provides, but minimal cost)\n\n**What the shop owner DOES receive:**\n- ✅ Apprentice's labor and service revenue\n- ✅ Tax credits (WOTC, up to $2,400-$9,600 depending on target group)\n\n**What the shop owner does NOT receive:**\n- ❌ Payment from apprentice\n- ❌ Payment from WIOA/WRG/JRI (funding goes to sponsor for RTI, not shop)\n- ❌ Payment from State Board\n- ❌ Payment from U.S. Department of Labor\n- ❌ Reimbursement for apprentice wages\n\n---\n\n### Why Would a Shop Owner Become a Sponsor?\n\n**If no one pays them, why do it?**\n\n**Reason 1: Build Your Team**\n- Train barbers your way\n- Develop loyal employees\n- Create pipeline of skilled staff\n- Apprentices often stay long-term after licensing\n\n**Reason 2: Revenue from Apprentice Work**\n- Apprentice generates revenue from day one\n- Shop keeps 50-60% of service revenue\n- Example: Apprentice does $750/week in services\n  - Shop pays apprentice: $400 base + $300 commission = $700\n  - Shop keeps: $450 (60% of $750)\n  - Shop's net: $450 - $700 = -$250 loss initially\n- But as apprentice improves (month 6+):\n  - Apprentice does $1,200/week in services\n  - Shop pays apprentice: $400 base + $480 commission = $880\n  - Shop keeps: $720 (60% of $1,200)\n  - Shop's net: $720 - $880 = -$160 loss\n- By month 12+:\n  - Apprentice does $1,500/week in services\n  - Shop pays apprentice: $400 base + $600 commission = $1,000\n  - Shop keeps: $900 (60% of $1,500)\n  - Shop's net: $900 - $1,000 = -$100 loss\n- After licensing (if apprentice stays):\n  - Licensed barber does $2,000/week in services\n  - Shop pays barber: $400 base + $800 commission = $1,200\n  - Shop keeps: $1,200 (60% of $2,000)\n  - Shop's net: $1,200 - $1,200 = $0 break-even to profit\n\n**Reason 3: Tax Benefits**\n- WOTC tax credit: Up to $2,400 per apprentice\n- Reduces tax liability\n- Apprentice wages are business expense (tax deductible)\n\n**Reason 4: Reputation**\n- Known as training facility\n- Attracts quality applicants\n- Community respect\n- Industry leadership\n\n**Reason 5: Give Back**\n- Help next generation\n- Strengthen the profession\n- Support workforce development\n- Personal satisfaction\n\n---\n\n### Common Misconceptions\n\n**Misconception 1: \"The government pays shops to train apprentices\"**\n\n❌ **Wrong.** The government does NOT pay shops at all. WIOA/WRG/JRI pays the RTI training provider directly, not the barbershop.\n\n**Misconception 2: \"Apprentices pay the shop for training\"**\n\n❌ **Wrong.** Apprentices do NOT pay the shop. The shop pays the apprentice wages.\n\n**Misconception 3: \"Third-party sponsors pay shops to host apprentices\"**\n\n❌ **Wrong.** Third-party sponsors do NOT pay shops. Shops pay apprentice wages themselves.\n\n**Misconception 4: \"Shops make money from apprentices\"**\n\n**It depends.** Shops invest in apprentices as a long-term strategy to build their team. The financial outcome varies based on the apprentice's skill development and whether they stay after licensing.\n\n---\n\n### Financial Reality for Shop Owners\n\n**Cost to become apprenticeship sponsor:**\n- Registration fees: $0 (FREE - no cost to register)\n- Annual renewal: $0 (FREE)\n- Insurance increases: May increase slightly (varies by insurer)\n- Administrative time: 5-10 hours/month\n\n**Cost per apprentice (15-17 months):**\n- Wages: $20,000-$30,000\n- RTI curriculum: $0 (WIOA/WRG/JRI pays sponsor directly - shop pays nothing)\n- Tools and supplies: $200-500 (shop-provided tools)\n- **Total: $20,200-$30,500**\n\n**Revenue from apprentice (15-17 months):**\n- Service revenue: $30,000-$60,000 (depending on skill level and clientele)\n- Shop keeps 50-60%: $18,000-$36,000\n- WOTC tax credit: Up to $2,400 (if apprentice qualifies)\n\n**Net financial outcome for shop:**\n- Varies based on apprentice performance and skill development\n- Shop receives: Apprentice service revenue + WOTC tax credit\n- Shop pays: Apprentice wages + tools/supplies\n- Financial arrangements with Elevate: Negotiated in MOU\n- Most shops find apprenticeships financially beneficial long-term\n\n**Long-term benefit:**\n- If apprentice stays after licensing: Shop profits $10,000-$30,000/year from their work\n- If apprentice rents booth after licensing: Shop earns $250/week = $13,000/year rent\n- If apprentice leaves: Shop loses initial investment but helped the profession\n\n**Most shops view apprenticeships as long-term investment, not short-term profit.**\n\n---\n\n### The Bottom Line: Payment Structure\n\n**Who pays who:**\n\n✅ **Shop owner pays apprentice** ($10/hour + commissions)\n\n✅ **WIOA/WRG/JRI pays sponsor** (for apprentice's RTI curriculum - NOT the shop)\n\n✅ **Customers pay shop** (for services)\n\n✅ **Federal government gives shop tax credits** (WOTC, up to $2,400)\n\n❌ **Shop owner does NOT pay for RTI curriculum**\n\n❌ **WIOA/WRG/JRI does NOT pay shop owner**\n\n❌ **Shop owner pays ONLY apprentice wages - nothing else**\n\n❌ **Apprentice does NOT pay shop owner**\n\n❌ **Third-party sponsor does NOT pay shop owner** (usually)\n\n❌ **State Board does NOT pay shop owner**\n\n**Shop owners become sponsors to build their team, generate revenue from apprentice work, receive tax benefits, and give back to the profession—not because someone pays them to do it.**\n\n---\n\n## Does the Sponsor Supply the Barber Kit and Tools?\n\n### What Tools and Equipment Are Provided\n\n**Yes, the sponsor (shop owner) typically provides tools and equipment for apprentices to use.**\n\n**What the shop MUST provide (Indiana State Board requirement):**\n\n**Basic tools for daily use:**\n- ✅ Professional clippers (multiple sizes and guards)\n- ✅ Trimmers and edgers\n- ✅ Combs and brushes (various sizes)\n- ✅ Capes and neck strips\n- ✅ Spray bottles\n- ✅ Disinfectant and cleaning supplies\n- ✅ Towels and linens\n\n**Shop equipment:**\n- ✅ Barber chair at your station\n- ✅ Mirror and counter space\n- ✅ Access to shampoo bowl/sink\n- ✅ Blow dryers\n- ✅ Sanitation equipment (autoclave, disinfectant containers)\n\n**Products:**\n- ✅ Shampoo and conditioner\n- ✅ Aftershave and lotions\n- ✅ Styling products (pomade, gel, etc.)\n- ✅ Shaving cream\n- ✅ All client-facing products\n\n**Why shop provides these:**\n- Required by State Board regulations\n- Shop's responsibility as apprenticeship sponsor\n- Ensures quality and consistency\n- Part of training environment\n\n---\n\n### What About Your Personal Barber Kit?\n\n**You have options:**\n\n**Option 1: Use Shop's Tools (Most Common for Beginners)**\n\n**Months 1-6:**\n- Use shop-provided clippers, scissors, tools\n- Learn on shop equipment\n- No upfront cost to you\n- Shop maintains and replaces tools\n\n**Pros:**\n- ✅ $0 cost to start\n- ✅ Try different tools to see what you like\n- ✅ Shop handles maintenance and repairs\n- ✅ No risk if you damage tools while learning\n\n**Cons:**\n- ⚠️ Share tools with other barbers\n- ⚠️ May not be the exact tools you prefer\n- ⚠️ Can't take tools home to practice\n\n---\n\n**Option 2: Buy Your Own Kit (Common After Month 6+)**\n\n**As you progress:**\n- Many apprentices buy their own professional kit\n- Typically happens around month 6-9\n- Allows you to have your preferred tools\n- You can practice at home\n\n**What to buy (if you choose to):**\n\n**Essential personal kit ($300-$600):**\n- Professional clippers: $150-$300 (Wahl, Andis, Oster)\n- Trimmers/edgers: $50-$100\n- Professional scissors: $50-$150 (cutting and thinning)\n- Straight razor: $30-$80\n- Combs and brushes: $20-$40\n- Tool case: $30-$50\n\n**Advanced kit ($600-$1,200):**\n- Multiple clippers (corded and cordless)\n- High-end scissors ($200-$400)\n- Multiple trimmers\n- Professional razor\n- Full accessory set\n\n**Pros:**\n- ✅ Your own tools, your preference\n- ✅ Can practice at home\n- ✅ Build your professional kit\n- ✅ Take with you if you change shops\n- ✅ Shows commitment and professionalism\n\n**Cons:**\n- ⚠️ Upfront cost ($300-$1,200)\n- ⚠️ You're responsible for maintenance\n- ⚠️ Risk of damage or loss\n\n---\n\n**Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**\n\n**Months 1-6:**\n- Use shop-provided tools\n- Learn and practice\n- Figure out what you like\n\n**Months 7-12:**\n- Buy your own clippers ($150-$300)\n- Still use shop's scissors and other tools\n- Start building your kit gradually\n\n**Months 13-17:**\n- Complete your personal kit\n- Own all your primary tools\n- Use shop's backup tools as needed\n\n**After licensing:**\n- Have full professional kit\n- Ready to rent booth or work anywhere\n- Professional setup\n\n---\n\n### Does Funding (WIOA/WRG/JRI) Cover Tools?\n\n**It depends on the funding source:**\n\n**WIOA Funding:**\n- ✅ May cover basic tool kit (up to $500)\n- ✅ Considered \"support services\"\n- ✅ Must be approved by career counselor\n- ✅ Usually covers one-time purchase\n\n**Workforce Ready Grant:**\n- ❌ Typically does NOT cover tools\n- ✅ Only covers tuition and fees\n\n**JRI Funding:**\n- ✅ YES, covers tool kit (up to $500-$800)\n- ✅ Considered \"work clothing and equipment\"\n- ✅ JRI case manager approves purchase\n- ✅ Helps justice-involved individuals get started\n\n**Employer Sponsorship:**\n- Varies by shop\n- Some shops provide tools\n- Some shops give tool allowance ($200-$500)\n- Some shops require you to buy your own\n\n**Self-Pay:**\n- You're responsible for tools if you want your own\n- Can use shop tools for free\n\n---\n\n### What If You Can't Afford Your Own Kit?\n\n**You don't need to buy tools to start or complete the apprenticeship.**\n\n**Options if you can't afford tools:**\n\n**1.

Your stomach is in knots. You meet your mentor—a licensed barber with 15 years of experience. He shows you around. The smell of aftershave and clippers fills the air. You watch him work on his first client of the day. Every movement is precise. You think, \"I'll never be that good.\"\n\n**Week 1**\nYou're the helper. You sweep hair. You sanitize stations. You watch every cut. You learn the shop's rhythm—the busy times, the slow times, the regulars who come in every Saturday. You're earning $10/hour for every hour you're there. Your first paycheck: $400 for 40 hours. It's not much, but it's yours.\n\n**Week 2**\nYour mentor hands you clippers. \"Practice on this mannequin,\" he says. You spend hours working on fades. Your hands cramp. Your back hurts. But you're starting to understand the angles, the pressure, the technique.\n\n**Week 4**\nA regular customer, Mr. Johnson, comes in. He's been coming to this shop for 20 years. He watches you practice. \"You're gonna be good at this, young man,\" he says. You believe him.\n\n**Online Theory (Week 1-8):**\nYou complete 2-3 hours of online coursework each week. Sanitation protocols. Skin anatomy. Barbering history. Indiana licensing laws. It's dry, but you need it to pass your state exam.\n\n### Month 3-6: \"Someone Asked for Me\"\n\n**Month 3 - First Real Client**\nYour mentor says, \"You're ready.\" A walk-in customer needs a simple taper. Your hands shake as you pick up the clippers. Your mentor stands right behind you. \"Start with the guard. Slow and steady.\" You make your first pass. It's not perfect, but it's not terrible. Twenty minutes later, you're done. The customer looks in the mirror. He smiles. He tips you $5. You feel like you just won the lottery.\n\n**Month 4**\nYou're doing 2-3 cuts per day now. Simple tapers, basic fades. Your mentor still supervises every cut. You're earning commissions—$3-5 per cut. Your paychecks are growing: $400 base + $60-80 in commissions = $460-480/week.\n\n**Month 6 - The Turning Point**\nA customer walks in on a Saturday morning. He looks around. \"Is Marcus here?\" he asks. Your heart stops. Someone asked for you by name. You realize you're building something real. You've got 5-6 regulars now. Guys who trust you. Guys who come back.\n\n**Online Theory (Month 3-6):**\nYou're learning business skills now. How to price services. How to build clientele. How to handle difficult customers. You complete another 12 hours of coursework.\n\n### Month 7-12: \"I've Got Regulars\"\n\n**Month 9 - Independence**\nYou've got 12-15 regular clients now. You're doing fades, tapers, beard work, hot towel shaves. Your mentor doesn't supervise every cut anymore. He checks in, gives feedback, but you're working independently most of the time. You're earning $12-15/hour with commissions and tips.\n\n**Month 10 - Saturday Rush**\nSaturday morning, 9:00 AM. You've got five appointments booked. All regulars. All guys who specifically requested you. You're in the zone. Clippers humming. Conversation flowing. Tips adding up. By noon, you've made $120 in commissions and tips alone.\n\n**Month 12 - Halfway There**\nYou've completed 1,000 hours. Halfway to your license. You're making $600-700/week now. You've got 20+ regular clients. You're starting to think about what comes next—rent a chair? Stay with the shop? Open your own place someday?\n\n**Online Theory (Month 7-12):**\nYou're studying for your state exam now. Practice tests. Sanitation protocols. Indiana barbering laws. You've completed 72 of your 144 required theory hours.\n\n### Month 13-17: \"I'm Ready\"\n\n**Month 15 - Professional Level**\nYou're working at near-professional level now. You've got 25-30 regular clients. You're booked solid most days. You're earning $700-900/week. You're preparing for your state board exam. You're nervous, but you know you've got this.\n\n**Month 16 - State Board Exam Prep**\nYou complete your final theory hours. You practice your practical exam skills—taper, fade, shave, sanitation. Your mentor quizzes you on Indiana barbering laws. You schedule your exam with the Indiana State Board of Barber Examiners.\n\n**Month 17 - Exam Day**\nYou arrive at the testing center in Indianapolis. Written exam first—100 questions on theory, sanitation, laws. You finish in 45 minutes. Then the practical exam—demonstrate a taper, fade, and shave on a mannequin. The examiner watches every move. Two weeks later, you get the letter: **PASSED**.\n\n**License Day**\nYou pay your $45 licensing fee to the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency. You're now a **Registered Barber in Indiana**. Your regulars congratulate you. Your mentor shakes your hand. \"I'm proud of you,\" he says.\n\nYou decide to rent your own chair at the shop—$250/week. You keep 100% of your earnings after rent. You're in control of your future now.\n\n**Throughout:** You complete 144 hours of technical instruction and get mentored by licensed barbers every single day. You're never alone in this.\n\n---\n\n## What You'll Master\n\n✂️ **Cutting Skills:** Fades, tapers, lineups, beard work, hot towel shaves  \n🧼 **Sanitation:** Infection control and safety protocols  \n💬 **Client Relations:** Consultation, communication, building loyalty  \n💼 **Business:** Shop operations, pricing, customer retention  \n\n---\n\n## After You Graduate\n\n**Pass your state exam** → **Get your license** ($45 fee) → **Choose your path:**\n\n🪑 **Rent a chair** ($100-$300/week) and be your own boss  \n🏢 **Work for a shop** with steady income and benefits  \n🏪 **Open your own shop** and build a team  \n\n**Earning potential:** $35k-$65k/year. Top barbers earn $75k-$100k+.\n\n---\n\n## Real Talk: The Challenges\n\n**\"My feet hurt for the first month.\"** - Jamal, graduate  \nYou'll be on your feet 8+ hours a day. Your back will ache. Bring good shoes. It gets easier.\n\n**\"The first few months were slow.\"** - Sarah, current apprentice  \nYou won't have many clients at first. That's normal. By month 6, you'll have regulars. By graduation, you'll have a full book.\n\n**\"I had to balance work and coursework.\"** - DeAndre, graduate  \nYou'll work full-time at the shop AND complete 144 hours of technical instruction. It's demanding. But your employer knows you're learning, and we provide support.\n\n**\"Not every shop had openings.\"** - Tasha, graduate  \nThis program is new. Only federally approved shops can hire apprentices. Slots are competitive. But we're adding more shops every month.\n\n**\"It took longer than barber school.\"** - Marcus, graduate  \nYes, 2,000 hours vs. 1,500 hours. That's about 5 extra months. But you're getting paid for every single hour. Traditional students pay $25,000 and earn nothing. You earn $20,000+ and pay nothing.\n\n---\n\n## Who This Is For\n\n👨‍👩‍👧 Parents who need to earn while they learn  \n🔄 Career changers looking for a fresh start  \n🎓 Young adults who don't want college debt  \n✊ Justice-involved individuals seeking opportunity  \n💪 Anyone who's good with people and wants to work with their hands  \n\n---\n\n## How to Get Started\n\n**Step 1:** Apply below.

Where Does Your Hourly Wage Come From?\n\n**Your employer (the barbershop) pays you directly from their business revenue.**\n\nHere's the complete money flow:\n\n**Step 1: The Shop Earns Money**\n- Customers come in and pay for haircuts, shaves, beard trims\n- Shop charges: $25-40 per haircut, $15-25 per beard trim, $30-50 per shave\n- Money goes into the shop's cash register/payment system\n- This is the shop's gross revenue\n\n**Step 2: The Shop Pays Operating Costs**\n- Rent for the building ($2,000-5,000/month)\n- Utilities (electric, water, internet)\n- Products (shampoo, aftershave, towels, capes)\n- Equipment (clippers, scissors, chairs, mirrors)\n- Insurance (liability, workers' comp)\n- Licenses and permits\n- Marketing and advertising\n\n**Step 3: The Shop Pays Employee Wages (Including Yours)**\n- Licensed barbers: $15-25/hour or commission\n- Apprentices (you): $10/hour + commissions\n- Receptionists, cleaners, etc.\n- Payroll taxes (employer's share of Social Security, Medicare, unemployment)\n\n**Step 4: The Shop Keeps Profit**\n- Whatever's left after all expenses\n- Typically 15-30% profit margin for successful shops\n\n---\n\n## Scenario 1: Employee Model (Most

**Total:** **$400/week = $1,600/month**\n\n**Where the money comes from:**\n- Shop pays you from their general revenue\n- You're an investment for them—they're training you\n- They know you'll generate revenue later\n\n**Do you charge customers?**\n- ❌ No, you're not serving customers yet\n- You're observing and practicing\n\n**Do you pay booth rent?**\n- ❌ No, you're an employee, not a

**$30-75/week**\n- **Tips:** $3-5 per cut × 10-15 cuts/week = **$30-75/week**\n- **Total:** **$460-550/week = $1,840-2,200/month**\n\n**Where the money comes from:**\n\n**Example: Customer pays $25 for a haircut**\n\n1. **Customer pays shop:** $25 (cash, card, or app)\n2. **Shop keeps:** $15 (60% to cover costs and profit)\n3. **You earn commission:** $10 (40% commission)\n4. **Customer tips you:** $5 (goes directly to you)\n5. **Your total from this cut:** $10 commission + $5 tip = $15\n\n**Plus your hourly wage continues:**\n- You worked 1 hour doing that cut\n- You also earn $10/hour base wage\n- **Total for that hour:** $10 base + $10 commission + $5 tip = **$25**\n\n**Do you charge customers?**\n- ❌ No, the SHOP charges customers\n- Customer pays the shop's prices ($25-40 per cut)\n- Shop pays you commission (40-50% of the service price)\n\n**Do you pay booth rent?**\n- ❌ No, you're an employee\n- The shop pays rent for the building\n- You work in their space as an

from:**\n\n**Example: Busy Saturday**\n\nYou work 8 hours and do 8 haircuts:\n\n**Haircut 1:** Customer pays shop $30\n- Shop keeps: $18\n- You earn commission: $12 (40%)\n- Customer tips you: $6\n- Your earnings: $12 + $6 = $18\n\n**Haircut 2:** Customer pays shop $35 (fade)\n- Shop keeps: $21\n- You earn commission: $14 (40%)\n- Customer tips you: $7\n- Your earnings: $14 + $7 = $21\n\n**Repeat for 8 cuts...**\n\n**Your Saturday earnings:**\n- Base wage: 8 hours × $10 = $80\n- Commissions: 8 cuts × $12 avg = $96\n- Tips: 8 cuts × $6 avg = $48\n- **Total for the day: $224**\n\n**Do you charge customers?**\n- ❌ No, the SHOP charges customers\n- Shop sets the prices\n- Shop collects the money\n- Shop pays you commission\n\n**Do you pay booth rent?**\n- ❌ No, you're still an employee\n- Shop

per service × 30 services/week = **$360-450/week**\n- **Tips:** $6-8 per service × 30 services/week = **$180-240/week**\n- **Total:** **$940-1,090/week = $3,760-4,360/month**\n\n**Where the money comes from:**\n\n**Example: Full Week**\n\n**Monday-Friday (5 days):**\n- 4 clients per day × 5 days = 20 clients\n- Average service price: $30\n- Your commission: $12 per cut (40%)\n- Average tip: $6 per cut\n- **Earnings:** (20 × $12) + (20 × $6) = $240 + $120 = $360\n\n**Saturday (busy day):**\n- 8 clients\n- Average service price: $35\n- Your commission: $14 per cut (40%)\n- Average tip: $7 per

payroll\n\n---\n\n## The Critical Difference: Employee vs. Booth Renter\n\n### While You're an Apprentice (Employee)\n\n**Money flow:**\n1. Customer pays shop → $30\n2. Shop keeps → $18 (60%)\n3. Shop pays you commission → $12 (40%)\n4. Customer tips you directly → $5\n5. Shop pays your base wage → $10/hour\n6. **You receive:** Base wage + commission + tips\n\n**You pay:**\n- ❌ Nothing to the shop\n- ❌ No booth rent\n- ❌ No product costs\n- ❌ No equipment costs\n- ❌ No facility costs\n\n**Shop pays:**\n- ✅ Your wages ($10/hour)\n- ✅ Your commissions (40-50% of services)\n- ✅ Rent for the building\n- ✅ All products and supplies\n- ✅ All equipment\n- ✅ Utilities, insurance, licenses\n\n---\n\n### After You're Licensed (If You Rent a Booth)\n\n**Money flow:**\n1. Customer pays YOU directly → $30\n2. You keep → $30 (100%)\n3. Customer tips you → $5\n4. You pay shop booth rent → $250/week\n5. **You receive:** All service money + tips - booth rent\n\n**You pay:**\n- ✅ Booth rent ($100-300/week)\n- ✅ Your own products (shampoo, aftershave, etc.)\n- ✅ Your own equipment (clippers, scissors, etc.)\n- ✅ Your own taxes (self-employed, 1099)\n- ✅ Your own insurance\n\n**Shop provides:**\n- ✅ The physical space (chair, mirror, station)\n- ✅ Utilities (electric, water, internet)\n- ✅ Waiting area for clients\n- ✅ Receptionist (sometimes)\n\n**You're self-employed:**\n- You set your own prices\n- You keep 100% of revenue (after booth rent)\n- You handle your own taxes\n- You're your own boss\n\n---\n\n## Why Shops Hire Apprentices (Even Though It Costs Them Money)\n\n**Short-term cost:**\n- Shop pays you $10/hour even when you're not generating revenue\n- Shop invests time training you\n- Shop provides tools and products\n\n**Long-term benefit:**\n- Once you're skilled (month 6+), you generate revenue for the shop\n- You bring in clients who become shop regulars\n- You may stay as employee after licensing (shop keeps earning from your work)\n- You help the shop grow and serve more customers\n\n**Example: Month 12**\n- You do 25 cuts/week at $30 average = $750/week revenue\n- Shop pays you: $400 base + $300 commission = $700\n- Shop keeps: $450 (60% of service revenue)\n- Shop's net: $450 revenue - $700 wages = -$250 loss\n\n**Wait, the shop loses money?**\n\nNot quite. The shop also benefits from:\n- Your clients buying additional services (beard trims, shaves)\n- Your clients becoming shop regulars (lifetime value)\n- Your clients referring friends\n- Shop building reputation as training facility\n\n**By month 15-17:**\n- You're doing 30+ cuts/week at $35 average = $1,050/week revenue\n- Shop pays you: $400 base + $420 commission = $820\n- Shop keeps: $630 (60% of service revenue)\n- Shop's net: $630 revenue - $820 wages = -$190 loss\n\n**Still losing money?**\n\nYes, but:\n- Shop is investing in you\n- After you're licensed, you may stay as employee (shop profits from your work)\n- Or you rent a booth (shop earns $250/week rent from you)\n- Or you leave, but shop has helped the industry and built reputation\n\n---\n\n## The Bottom Line: Crystal Clear\n\n**During your 2,000-hour apprenticeship:**\n\n✅ **You ARE:**\n- A W-2 employee\n- Paid $10/hour base wage by the shop\n- Paid 40-50% commission on services you perform\n- Keeping 100% of tips\n- Covered by shop's insurance and workers' comp\n- Using shop's tools, products, and space for free\n\n❌ **You are NOT:**\n- Paying booth rent\n- Paying for products or tools\n- Charging customers directly (shop charges them)\n- Self-employed\n- Responsible for facility costs\n\n**The shop pays you. You don't pay the shop. Period.**\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 2: Commission-Only Model (Less Common for Apprentices)\n\n**How it works:**\n- You're still an employee, but paid primarily through commissions\n- Minimum wage guaranteed by law\n- You earn percentage of every service you perform\n\n**What you earn:**\n- **Commission rate:** 50-60% of service price\n- **Guaranteed minimum:** At least minimum wage ($7.25/hour federal, higher in some cities)\n- **Tips:** 100% of tips go to you\n\n**Example:**\n- Haircut costs $25\n- You earn 50% = $12.50 per cut\n- Do 4 cuts in an hour = $50/hour\n- Plus tips (typically $5-10 per cut)\n\n**Early months:**\n- You won't have many clients yet\n- Shop guarantees minimum wage\n- As you build clientele, commissions grow\n\n**You do NOT pay:**\n- ❌ Booth rent\n- ❌ Chair rental\n- ❌ Product costs (shop provides)\n- ❌ Equipment costs (shop provides)\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 3: Hybrid Model (Some Shops)\n\n**How it works:**\n- Lower base hourly rate ($7-8/hour)\n- Higher commission rate (50-60%)\n- Combines stability of hourly with upside of commission\n\n**What you earn:**\n- **Base wage:** $8/hour (40 hours = $320/week)\n- **Commissions:** 50-60% of services\n- **Tips:** 100% of tips\n\n**Example weekly earnings:**\n- **Month 1-2:** $320/week (mostly base pay)\n- **Month 3-6:** $400-500/week (base + growing commissions)\n- **Month 7-12:** $550-700/week (base + regular commissions + tips)\n- **Month 13-17:** $700-900/week (base + strong commissions + tips)\n\n**You do NOT pay:**\n- ❌ Booth rent\n- ❌ Chair rental\n- ❌ Product costs (shop provides)\n- ❌ Equipment costs (shop provides)\n\n---\n\n## What About Booth Rent? (After You're Licensed)\n\n**During your apprenticeship: You do NOT pay booth rent.**\n\nYou're an employee learning a trade. The shop pays you. You don't pay them.\n\n**After you get your license:**\n\nThen you have options:\n\n### Option A: Stay as Employee\n- Continue earning hourly + commissions\n- Shop provides everything\n- Steady income, less risk\n- Typical earnings: $35,000-50,000/year\n\n### Option B: Rent a Chair/Booth\n- Pay weekly rent ($100-300/week)\n- Keep 100% of your earnings after rent\n- You're self-employed (1099)\n- You buy your own products and tools\n- You set your own prices\n- Typical earnings: $50,000-75,000/year (if you have strong clientele)\n\n### Option C: Open Your Own Shop\n- Highest earning potential\n- Most responsibility and risk\n- Need business license, insurance, startup capital\n- Typical earnings: $75,000-150,000+/year (if successful)\n\n**Most apprentices stay as employees for 1-2 years after licensing to build their clientele before renting a chair.**\n\n---\n\n## Common Questions: Let's Clear Up Every Confusion\n\n### \"Do I cut hair for free?\"\n\n**No. You NEVER cut hair for free.**\n\nEvery single haircut you do, you get paid for. Here's exactly how:\n\n**Month 1-2 (Observation phase):**\n- You're NOT cutting hair yet\n- You're watching, learning, practicing on mannequins\n- You're earning $10/hour just to observe and learn\n- **You're getting paid to learn, not cutting for free**\n\n**Month 3+ (Once you start cutting):**\n- Customer pays the shop $30 for a haircut\n- Shop pays you $12 commission (40% of $30)\n- Customer tips you $5 directly\n- You also earn your $10/hour base wage\n- **Total for that cut: $10 hourly + $12 commission + $5 tip = $27**\n- **You're getting paid THREE ways for every cut**\n\n**You NEVER work for free. Every hour, every cut, you're earning money.**\n\n---\n\n### \"Can I get my own clients and charge them directly?\"\n\n**No. Not during your apprenticeship.**\n\nHere's why and how it works:\n\n**During apprenticeship (15-17 months):**\n- ❌ You CANNOT charge customers directly\n- ❌ You CANNOT take clients outside the shop\n- ❌ You CANNOT set your own prices\n- ✅ The SHOP charges customers (their prices, their system)\n- ✅ The SHOP pays you commission (40-50% of the service price)\n- ✅ You keep 100% of tips\n\n**Why this rule exists:**\n- You're not licensed yet (illegal to charge for services without a license)\n- You're working under the shop's license and insurance\n- The shop is responsible for quality and customer satisfaction\n- The shop is training you and taking on the risk\n\n**After you get your license:**\n- Then you can choose to rent a booth and charge customers directly\n- Or stay as employee and continue earning commission\n- Or open your own shop\n\n---\n\n### \"How does the money breakdown work exactly?\"\n\n**Let me show you with a real example:**\n\n**Customer walks in and wants a fade - $35**\n\n**Step 1: Customer pays the shop**\n- Customer pays $35 to the shop (cash, card, or app)\n- Money goes into shop's register/system\n\n**Step 2: Shop keeps their portion**\n- Shop keeps 60% = $21\n- This covers: rent, utilities, products, insurance, profit\n\n**Step 3: Shop pays you commission**\n- You earn 40% = $14 commission\n- This goes on your paycheck (paid biweekly or weekly)\n\n**Step 4: Customer tips you**\n- Customer gives you $7 tip (cash or added to card)\n- You keep 100% of tips\n\n**Step 5: You also earn hourly wage**\n- That cut took you 30 minutes\n- You earn $10/hour = $5 for that 30 minutes\n\n**Your total earnings from that one $35 fade:**\n- Hourly wage: $5\n- Commission: $14\n- Tip: $7\n- **Total: $26 for 30 minutes of work**\n\n**Shop's earnings from that same $35 fade:**\n- Revenue: $35\n- Minus your commission: -$14\n- Minus your hourly wage: -$5\n- **Shop keeps: $16**\n\n**Shop uses that $16 to pay:**\n- Rent ($2,000-5,000/month ÷ 160 cuts = $12.50-31.25 per cut)\n- Products ($2-3 per cut)\n- Utilities ($1-2 per cut)\n- Insurance ($1-2 per cut)\n- Profit (whatever's left)\n\n---\n\n### \"Does the shop HAVE to pay me?\"\n\n**Yes. By law.**\n\n**Federal and Indiana labor laws require:**\n- You must be paid at least minimum wage ($7.25/hour federal, higher in some cities)\n- You must be paid for every hour worked\n- You must receive overtime if you work over 40 hours/week\n- You must receive a paycheck with taxes withheld\n- You must receive a W-2 at tax time\n\n**The shop cannot:**\n- ❌ Make you work for free\n- ❌ Pay you \"under the table\" without taxes\n- ❌ Withhold your wages\n- ❌ Make you pay them to work there (during apprenticeship)\n\n**If a shop tries to make you work for free or pay booth rent during your apprenticeship, that's illegal. Report it immediately.**\n\n---\n\n### \"Are there alternative payment options?\"\n\n**Yes. Shops can structure apprentice pay in different ways, but you ALWAYS get paid.**\n\n**IMPORTANT: It's usually EITHER hourly OR commission, not both (except in hybrid models).**\n\n---\n\n## Payment Structure Options\n\n### Option 1: Hourly Wage ONLY (Simple, Guaranteed)\n\n**How it works:**\n- You earn a fixed hourly rate\n- No commission on services\n- You keep 100% of tips\n- Guaranteed income regardless of how many clients you serve\n\n**Typical rates:**\n- $10-12/hour for apprentices\n- $12-15/hour for advanced apprentices (month 9+)\n\n**Example weekly earnings:**\n- 40 hours × $10/hour = $400/week\n- Plus tips: $100-150/week\n- **Total: $500-550/week**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Predictable income\n- Get paid even during slow times\n- Get paid while observing and learning\n- Simple to understand\n\n**Cons:**\n- No upside when you're busy\n- Don't earn more for bringing in clients\n- Lower earning potential\n\n**Best for:**\n- Early apprentices (month 1-6)\n- People who want stable, predictable income\n- Shops that want simple payroll\n\n---\n\n### Option 2: Commission ONLY (Higher Earning Potential)\n\n**How it works:**\n- You earn a percentage of every service you perform\n- No base hourly wage\n- You keep 100% of tips\n- **BUT: Federal law requires minimum wage guarantee**\n\n**Typical commission rates:**\n- 50-60% of service price for apprentices\n- 60-70% for advanced apprentices (month 9+)\n\n**Minimum wage protection:**\n- If your commission doesn't equal minimum wage ($7.25/hour federal), shop must pay the difference\n- Example: You work 40 hours but only earn $200 in commission\n- Minimum wage = 40 hours × $7.25 = $290\n- Shop must pay you an additional $90 to reach minimum wage\n\n**Example weekly earnings:**\n\n**Month 3-6 (10-15 cuts/week):**\n- 12 cuts × $30 average = $360 revenue\n- Your commission (50%) = $180\n- Plus tips: $60\n- **Total: $240/week**\n- **BUT: Minimum wage = $290, so shop pays you $290 + $60 tips = $350/week**\n\n**Month 7-12 (20-25 cuts/week):**\n- 22 cuts × $30 average = $660 revenue\n- Your commission (50%) = $330\n- Plus tips: $110\n- **Total: $440/week** (above minimum wage, so you keep it all)\n\n**Month 13-17 (30-35 cuts/week):**\n- 32 cuts × $32 average = $1,024 revenue\n- Your commission (60%) = $614\n- Plus tips: $160\n- **Total: $774/week**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Higher earning potential\n- Earn more when you're busy\n- Rewarded for bringing in clients\n- Incentive to improve skills\n\n**Cons:**\n- Income varies week to week\n- Slow weeks mean lower pay (but minimum wage protected)\n- More pressure to perform\n- Early months are tough (few clients)\n\n**Best for:**\n- Advanced apprentices (month 6+)\n- People who are motivated by performance pay\n- Apprentices with strong clientele\n\n---\n\n### Option 3: Hybrid Model (Base + Commission)\n\n**How it works:**\n- Lower base hourly wage\n- Plus commission on services\n- You keep 100% of tips\n- Combines stability with upside\n\n**Typical structure:**\n- $7-8/hour base wage\n- Plus 40-50% commission on services\n- Plus 100% of tips\n\n**Example weekly earnings:**\n\n**Month 3-6:**\n- Base: 40 hours × $8/hour = $320\n- Commission: 12 cuts × $30 × 40% = $144\n- Tips: $60\n- **Total: $524/week**\n\n**Month 7-12:**\n- Base: 40 hours × $8/hour = $320\n- Commission: 22 cuts × $30 × 45% = $297\n- Tips: $110\n- **Total: $727/week**\n\n**Month 13-17:**\n- Base: 40 hours × $8/hour = $320\n- Commission: 32 cuts × $32 × 50% = $512\n- Tips: $160\n- **Total: $992/week**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Guaranteed base income\n- Upside from commission\n- Less risky than commission-only\n- Balanced approach\n\n**Cons:**\n- More complex to calculate\n- Lower base than hourly-only\n- Lower commission than commission-only\n\n**Best for:**\n- Most apprentices (month 3+)\n- People who want balance\n- Shops that want to incentivize performance while providing stability\n\n---\n\n### Option 4: Flat Weekly Salary (Very Rare)\n\n**How it works:**\n- Fixed amount per week\n- No hourly tracking\n- No commission\n- You keep 100% of tips\n\n**Typical rates:**\n- $400-600/week for apprentices\n\n**Example weekly earnings:**\n- Salary: $500/week\n- Tips: $100-150/week\n- **Total: $600-650/week**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Extremely predictable\n- No tracking hours or services\n- Simple\n\n**Cons:**\n- No upside for performance\n- Rare to find\n- May not comply with overtime laws if you work over 40 hours\n\n**Best for:**\n- Very rare arrangement\n- Usually only for experienced apprentices\n\n---\n\n### Option 5: Booth Rent Model for Apprentices (VERY RARE - Advanced Only)\n\n**IMPORTANT: This is NOT standard for apprentices. Only available in special circumstances for advanced apprentices who have strong clientele.**\n\n**How it works:**\n- You pay the shop weekly booth rent ($100-200/week for apprentices, less than licensed barbers)\n- You keep 100% of what customers pay you\n- You set your own prices (within shop guidelines)\n- You keep 100% of tips\n- You're still an employee (W-2), not self-employed yet\n\n**Requirements to qualify:**\n- Must have completed at least 1,500 hours (500 or fewer hours remaining)\n- OR must be month 12+ in your apprenticeship\n- Must have 20+ regular clients\n- Must be working at near-professional level\n- Must have shop owner approval\n- Must still complete your remaining hours and 144 theory hours\n- Must still work under supervision (you're not licensed yet)\n\n---\n\n## Special Case: Transfer Students with Advanced Hours\n\n**If you transferred hours from barber school and only have 500 hours left:**\n\n**Example: You completed 1,500 hours at barber school, need 500 more hours**\n\n**You may qualify for booth rent immediately IF:**\n- ✅ You have professional-level skills (verified by shop owner)\n- ✅ You have 20+ regular clients or can build them quickly\n- ✅ You're working at near-licensed level\n- ✅ Shop owner approves\n- ✅ You understand the financial risk\n\n**Why this makes sense:**\n- You've already completed 75% of your training\n- You have professional skills\n- You're only 3-4 months from licensing\n- Booth rent lets you practice running your own business\n- You can earn more than commission if you have strong clientele\n\n**Example timeline:**\n- **Week 1-4:** Start on commission (50-60%) to build clientele at new shop\n- **Week 5+:** Switch to booth rent once you have 15-20 regular clients\n- **Month 3-4:** Complete your 500 hours, take state exam, get licensed\n- **After licensing:** Continue booth rent or negotiate better terms\n\n**Financial comparison for transfer student with 500 hours left:**\n\n**Commission model (50%):**\n- 25 cuts/week × $30 = $750 revenue\n- Your commission: $375\n- Your tips: $150\n- **Total: $525/week × 16 weeks = $8,400**\n\n**Booth rent model:**\n- 25 cuts/week × $30 = $750 revenue\n- Minus rent: -$150\n- Your tips: $150\n- **Total: $750/week × 16 weeks = $12,000**\n\n**Booth rent earns $3,600 more over your remaining 500 hours (16 weeks).**\n\n**BUT: Only if you maintain 25+ clients per week. If you're new to the shop and don't have clients yet, commission is safer.**\n\n---\n\n## Transfer Student Scenarios: Which Payment Model?\n\n### Scenario 1: Transfer with 1,500 hours completed, 500 hours remaining\n\n**Skill level:** Professional (you've completed barber school)  \n**Clientele:** None at new shop (you just transferred)  \n**Time remaining:** 3-4 months\n\n**Recommended payment model:**\n- **Week 1-4:** Commission (50-60%) while you build clientele\n- **Week 5-16:** Booth rent ($150/week) once you have 20+ clients\n\n**Why:**\n- You have the skills, but not the clients yet\n- Commission gives you safety net while building clientele\n- Switch to booth rent once you're busy\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 2: Transfer with 1,000 hours completed, 1,000 hours remaining\n\n**Skill level:** Intermediate (halfway through training)  \n**Clientele:** None at new shop  \n**Time remaining:** 6-8 months\n\n**Recommended payment model:**\n- **Month 1-3:** Hourly ($10/hour) or commission (40-50%)\n- **Month 4-6:** Commission (50-60%)\n- **Month 7-8:** Booth rent ($150/week) if you have 25+ clients\n\n**Why:**\n- You're still developing skills\n- Need time to build clientele\n- Booth rent only makes sense in final months\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 3: Transfer with 500 hours completed, 1,500 hours remaining\n\n**Skill level:** Beginner (just started training)  \n**Clientele:** None  \n**Time remaining:** 12-15 months\n\n**Recommended payment model:**\n- **Month 1-6:** Hourly ($10/hour)\n- **Month 7-12:** Commission (50%)\n- **Month 13-15:** Commission (60%) or booth rent if you have 25+ clients\n\n**Why:**\n- You're still learning\n- Need guaranteed income while developing skills\n- Booth rent only makes sense at the very end\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 4: Transfer with 1,800 hours completed, 200 hours remaining\n\n**Skill level:** Near-professional  \n**Clientele:** May have some from previous shop  \n**Time remaining:** 1-2 months\n\n**Recommended payment model:**\n- **Booth rent immediately ($150/week)** if you have 20+ clients\n- **OR commission (60%)** if you're building clientele\n\n**Why:**\n- You're almost done\n- If you have clients, booth rent maximizes earnings\n- If you don't have clients, commission is safer for short period\n\n---\n\n## Key Decision Factors: Commission vs. Booth Rent for Transfer Students\n\n**Choose COMMISSION if:**\n- ❌ You don't have 20+ regular clients yet\n- ❌ You're new to the shop and building clientele\n- ❌ You're still developing skills\n- ❌ You have more than 6 months remaining\n- ❌ You want guaranteed income\n\n**Choose BOOTH RENT if:**\n- ✅ You have 20+ regular clients\n- ✅ You're working at professional level\n- ✅ You have 500 or fewer hours remaining (3-4 months)\n- ✅ Shop owner approves\n- ✅ You understand the financial risk\n\n---\n\n## How to Negotiate Booth Rent as a Transfer Student\n\n**If you transferred 1,500 hours and only need 500 more:**\n\n**Step 1: Prove your skills**\n- Work on commission for 2-4 weeks\n- Show shop owner your skill level\n- Demonstrate you can handle professional-level work\n\n**Step 2: Build clientele**\n- Get 15-20 regular clients\n- Show consistent bookings\n- Prove you can stay busy\n\n**Step 3: Make your case**\n- \"I've completed 1,500 hours of training\"\n- \"I'm working at professional level\"\n- \"I have 20 regular clients\"\n- \"I'd like to switch to booth rent for my remaining 500 hours\"\n- \"This will help me practice running my own business before I get licensed\"\n\n**Step 4: Negotiate terms**\n- Booth rent: $100-150/week (less than licensed barbers pay)\n- Trial period: 2-4 weeks to see if it works\n- Option to switch back to commission if needed\n\n**Step 5: Get it in writing**\n- Written agreement\n- Booth rent amount\n- Payment schedule\n- Terms and conditions\n- Still tracked as apprentice hours\n\n**Example weekly earnings:**\n\n**If you do 25 cuts/week at $30 each:**\n- Revenue: 25 × $30 = $750\n- Minus booth rent: -$150\n- Plus tips: 25 × $6 = $150\n- **Total: $750/week**\n\n**Pros:**\n- Keep 100% of service revenue (after rent)\n- Higher earning potential than commission\n- More independence\n- Set your own schedule (within shop hours)\n- Practice running your own business\n\n**Cons:**\n- You pay rent even on slow weeks\n- Risk: If you don't have enough clients, you lose money\n- No guaranteed income\n- You pay for your own products and tools\n- More responsibility\n\n**Financial risk example:**\n\n**Good week (30 cuts):**\n- Revenue: 30 × $30 = $900\n- Minus rent: -$150\n- Plus tips: $180\n- **Profit: $930**\n\n**Slow week (10 cuts):**\n- Revenue: 10 × $30 = $300\n- Minus rent: -$150\n- Plus tips: $60\n- **Profit: $210** (much less than commission or hourly)\n\n**Very slow week (5 cuts):**\n- Revenue: 5 × $30 = $150\n- Minus rent: -$150\n- Plus tips: $30\n- **Profit: $30** (you barely break even)\n\n---\n\n## Booth Rent for Apprentices: Is It Legal?\n\n**Yes, BUT only under specific conditions:**\n\n**Legal if:**\n- ✅ You're an advanced apprentice (month 12+) with strong clientele\n- ✅ You voluntarily choose this arrangement\n- ✅ You're still tracked as an employee (W-2)\n- ✅ Your hours still count toward your 2,000-hour requirement\n- ✅ You're still supervised by a licensed barber\n- ✅ Shop still provides apprenticeship training and oversight\n\n**Illegal if:**\n- ❌ Shop forces you to pay booth rent from day one\n- ❌ You're early in your apprenticeship (month 1-6)\n- ❌ You don't have enough clients to make it work\n- ❌ Shop doesn't track your hours or provide supervision\n- ❌ Shop treats you as self-employed (1099) before you're licensed\n\n**Why this option exists:**\n- Some advanced apprentices want to practice running their own business\n- Prepares you for renting a booth after licensing\n- Can earn more if you have strong clientele\n- Gives you more control and independence\n\n**Why most apprentices DON'T choose this:**\n- Too risky early on (you don't have clients yet)\n- Commission or hourly is more stable\n- You're still learning, so guaranteed income is better\n- Most shops don't offer this to apprentices\n\n---\n\n## Booth Rent vs. Commission: Which Earns More?\n\n**Let's compare for an advanced apprentice doing 25 cuts/week at $30 each:**\n\n**Commission Model (50%):**\n- Revenue to shop: 25 × $30 = $750\n- Your commission: $375 (50%)\n- Your tips: $150\n- **Total: $525/week**\n\n**Booth Rent Model:**\n- Revenue to you: 25 × $30 = $750\n- Minus booth rent: -$150\n- Your tips: $150\n- **Total: $750/week**\n\n**Booth rent earns $225 more per week IF you have consistent clientele.**\n\n**But if you only do 15 cuts/week:**\n\n**Commission Model:**\n- Your commission: $225 (50% of $450)\n- Your tips: $90\n- **Total: $315/week**\n\n**Booth Rent Model:**\n- Revenue: $450\n- Minus rent: -$150\n- Your tips: $90\n- **Total: $390/week**\n\n**Booth rent still earns more, but the gap is smaller.**\n\n**If you only do 10 cuts/week:**\n\n**Commission Model:**\n- Your commission: $150 (50% of $300)\n- Your tips: $60\n- **Total: $210/week**\n\n**Booth Rent Model:**\n- Revenue: $300\n- Minus rent: -$150\n- Your tips: $60\n- **Total: $210/week**\n\n**Break-even point.**\n\n**If you only do 5 cuts/week:**\n\n**Commission Model:**\n- Your commission: $75 (50% of $150)\n- Your tips: $30\n- **Total: $105/week**\n\n**Booth Rent Model:**\n- Revenue: $150\n- Minus rent: -$150\n- Your tips: $30\n- **Total: $30/week**\n\n**Commission earns WAY more on slow weeks.**\n\n---\n\n## Should You Pay Booth Rent as an Apprentice?\n\n**For most apprentices: NO.**\n\n**Stick with hourly or commission until:**\n- You're month 12+ in your apprenticeship\n- You have 25+ regular clients per week\n- You're confident in your skills\n- You understand the financial risk\n- You want to practice running your own business\n\n**After you get your license:**\n- Then booth rental makes more sense\n- You have full clientele\n- You're experienced\n- You can charge higher prices\n- You're ready to be self-employed\n\n**The safest path:**\n1. Month 1-6: Hourly ($10/hour)\n2. Month 7-12: Commission (50%)\n3. Month 13-17: Commission (60%)\n4. After licensing: Booth rental ($200-300/week) or stay as employee\n\n---\n\n## The Bottom Line: Booth Rent Option\n\n**Yes, there IS an option to pay booth rent and keep 100% of what customers pay you.**\n\n**BUT:**\n- ❌ Not recommended for early apprentices (month 1-11)\n- ❌ Only for advanced apprentices with strong clientele\n- ❌ Risky if you don't have consistent clients\n- ✅ Can earn more IF you have 25+ clients per week\n- ✅ Good practice for running your own business after licensing\n\n**Most apprentices should stick with:**\n- Hourly or commission during apprenticeship\n- Switch to booth rental AFTER getting licensed\n\n---\n\n## Commission Rate Breakdown by Service Type\n\n**If you're on commission-only or hybrid, here's what you typically earn:**\n\n| Service | Shop Charges | Your Commission (50%) | Your Commission (60%) |\n|---------|--------------|----------------------|----------------------|\n| Basic Cut | $25 | $12.50 | $15.00 |\n| Fade/Taper | $30-35 | $15-17.50 | $18-21 |\n| Beard Trim | $15-20 | $7.50-10 | $9-12 |\n| Hot Towel Shave | $35-45 | $17.50-22.50 | $21-27 |\n| Cut + Beard | $40-50 | $20-25 | $24-30 |\n| Kids Cut | $20-25 | $10-12.50 | $12-15 |\n\n**Plus tips (typically 15-20% of service price):**\n- $25 cut → $5 tip\n- $35 fade → $7 tip\n- $45 shave → $9 tip\n\n---\n\n## Which Payment Structure Is Best?\n\n**Month 1-2 (Observation phase):**\n- **Best: Hourly only ($10-12/hour)**\n- You're not cutting yet, so commission doesn't make sense\n- You need guaranteed income while learning\n\n**Month 3-6 (First clients):**\n- **Best: Hourly only OR Hybrid**\n- You're just starting to cut, so commission-only is risky\n- Hybrid gives you stability plus small upside\n\n**Month 7-12 (Building clientele):**\n- **Best: Hybrid OR Commission-only**\n- You're cutting regularly, so commission makes sense\n- Hybrid if you want safety net, commission-only if you're confident\n\n**Month 13-17 (Near-professional):**\n- **Best: Commission-only (60-70%)**\n- You have strong clientele, so commission maximizes earnings\n- You're earning well above minimum wage\n\n---\n\n## Can I Switch Payment Structures?\n\n**Yes, many apprentices start hourly and switch to commission as they progress.**\n\n**Common progression:**\n1. **Month 1-2:** Hourly only ($10/hour)\n2. **Month 3-6:** Hybrid ($8/hour + 40% commission)\n3. **Month 7-12:** Hybrid ($8/hour + 50% commission)\n4. **Month 13-17:** Commission-only (60% commission)\n\n**Talk to your employer about switching when:**\n- You're consistently serving 15+ clients per week\n- Your commission would exceed your hourly wage\n- You're confident in your skills and clientele\n\n---\n\n## The Bottom Line: Payment Structure\n\n**You get paid ONE of these ways:**\n\n1. **Hourly ONLY:** $10-12/hour + tips\n2. **Commission ONLY:** 50-70% of services + tips (minimum wage guaranteed)\n3. **Hybrid:** $7-8/hour + 40-50% commission + tips\n4. **Salary:** $400-600/week + tips (rare)\n\n**You do NOT get:**\n- ❌ Full hourly ($10/hour) AND full commission (50%) on the same services\n- ❌ That would be double-paying\n\n**Exception: Hybrid model**\n- ✅ Lower hourly ($7-8) + commission (40-50%)\n- This is designed to balance out\n\n**All options are legal as long as:**\n- You earn at least minimum wage\n- You're paid for every hour worked\n- Taxes are withheld properly\n- You receive regular paychecks\n\n---\n\n### \"What if the shop says I have to pay booth rent as an apprentice?\"\n\n**That's illegal. Don't do it.**\n\n**During your apprenticeship:**\n- You're an EMPLOYEE, not a booth renter\n- Employees don't pay rent to their employer\n- The shop must pay YOU, not the other way around\n\n**If a shop asks you to pay booth rent during apprenticeship:**\n1. That shop is NOT following apprenticeship rules\n2. They're likely not an approved apprenticeship sponsor\n3. Your hours won't count toward your license\n4. You won't be eligible for the state exam\n5. You're being scammed\n\n**Booth rental is ONLY for licensed barbers who are self-employed.**\n\n**After you get your license, then you can choose to rent a booth if you want.**\n\n---\n\n### \"Can I bring my own clients to the shop?\"\n\n**Yes, but the shop still charges them and pays you commission.**\n\n**Here's how it works:**\n\n**Scenario: Your friend wants you to cut his hair**\n\n**During apprenticeship:**\n- Your friend comes to the shop\n- He pays the shop's price ($30)\n- Shop pays you commission ($12)\n- Your friend tips you ($5)\n- **You earn: $12 commission + $5 tip + hourly wage**\n\n**You cannot:**\n- ❌ Charge your friend directly\n- ❌ Cut his hair outside the shop\n- ❌ Set your own price\n- ❌ Keep the full $30\n\n**Why:**\n- You're not licensed yet\n- You're working under the shop's license\n- The shop is liable for your work\n- The shop provides the space, tools, and insurance\n\n**After you get your license and rent a booth:**\n- Then your friend pays YOU directly\n- You keep the full $30 (minus booth rent)\n- You set your own prices\n- You're self-employed\n\n---\n\n### \"What if I'm really good and bring in lots of clients? Can I negotiate higher pay?\"\n\n**Yes, absolutely.**\n\n**After month 6-9, if you're bringing in strong business:**\n- You can negotiate higher commission (50-60% instead of 40%)\n- You can negotiate higher base wage ($12-15/hour instead of $10)\n- You can negotiate bonuses for hitting targets\n\n**Example negotiation:**\n- \"I'm doing 30 cuts per week and bringing in $900/week in revenue\"\n- \"Can we increase my commission from 40% to 50%?\"\n- \"That would increase my earnings from $360 to $450 per week\"\n\n**Shops want to keep good apprentices:**\n- If you're skilled and bringing in clients, you have leverage\n- Shops would rather pay you more than lose you\n- Negotiating is normal and expected\n\n---\n\n### \"Do I pay the shop anything during my apprenticeship?\"\n\n**No. Nothing. Zero. Not a penny.**\n\nYou do NOT pay:\n- ❌ Booth rent\n- ❌ Chair rental\n- ❌ Product costs\n- ❌ Equipment costs\n- ❌ Training fees (if you have funding)\n- ❌ Facility fees\n- ❌ Anything else\n\n**The shop pays YOU. You don't pay the shop.**\n\n---\n\n### \"What if I don't have any clients yet?\"\n\n**You still get paid your base hourly wage.**\n\nEven if you're just observing and practicing, you're earning $10/hour. The shop is investing in you.\n\n---\n\n### \"What if the shop is slow and there aren't many clients?\"\n\n**You still get paid your hourly wage.**\n\nSlow days mean less commission, but your base pay is guaranteed. You can't lose money on a slow day.\n\n---\n\n### \"What if I mess up a haircut?\"\n\n**You're covered. You still get paid.**\n\n- You're learning\n- Your mentor supervises\n- If there's an issue, the shop handles it (refund, redo, etc.)\n- You still earn your hourly wage\n- You might not get commission on that specific cut if the shop refunds the customer\n- But you don't lose money or get penalized\n\n---\n\n### \"Can I work at multiple shops to complete my hours faster?\"\n\n**No. You must work at ONE registered apprenticeship sponsor shop.**\n\n- You can't split time between shops\n- You can't work side jobs as a barber (you're not licensed yet)\n- All your hours must be at your registered shop\n- If you leave one shop, you transfer to another approved shop\n\n---\n\n### \"What if I want to leave and go to a different shop?\"\n\n**You can transfer. Your hours go with you.**\n\nIf your employment ends or you want to switch shops:\n1. We help you find a new approved shop\n2. Your completed hours transfer\n3. You continue from where you left off\n4. New shop pays you the same way\n\n---\n\n## The Bottom Line: You ALWAYS Get Paid\n\n**Every scenario, every situation, you're earning money:**\n\n✅ Observing and learning → $10/hour  \n✅ Practicing on mannequins → $10/hour  \n✅ Cutting your first client → $10/hour + commission + tips  \n✅ Building your clientele → $10/hour + commission + tips  \n✅ Slow days → $10/hour guaranteed  \n✅ Busy days → $10/hour + lots of commission + lots of tips  \n\n**You NEVER:**\n❌ Cut hair for free  \n❌ Pay booth rent  \n❌ Pay the shop anything  \n❌ Work without getting paid  \n\n**The shop pays you. Period. That's the law. That's the program.**\n\n---\n\n## The Bottom Line: You're an Employee, Not a Renter\n\n**During your 2,000-hour apprenticeship:**\n- ✅ You're a W-2 employee\n- ✅ The shop pays you ($10/hour + commissions + tips)\n- ✅ The shop provides tools, products, workspace\n- ✅ You pay nothing to the shop\n- ✅ You earn $20,000-30,000+ over 15-17 months\n\n**After you get your license:**\n- Then you choose: stay as employee, rent a chair, or open your own shop\n\n**You're not paying to learn. You're earning while you learn.**\n\n### What if I lose my job at the barbershop?\n\n**We'll help you find a new placement.** If your employment ends (for any reason), we work with you to find another approved shop. Your hours are tracked and transfer with you.\n\n### Do I get benefits like health insurance?\n\n**It depends on the employer.** Some shops offer benefits, some don't. You're an employee, so you're eligible for whatever benefits the shop provides to other employees.\n\n### Can I work part-time?\n\n**The program is designed for full-time (40 hours/week).** Part-time may be possible, but it will take longer to complete your 2,000 hours. Most funding sources require full-time participation.\n\n### What happens if I fail the state exam?\n\n**You can retake it (per Indiana State Board policy).**\n\n**Indiana State Board Exam consists of:**\n1. **Written Exam:** 100 multiple-choice questions\n   - Barbering theory and techniques\n   - Sanitation and safety\n   - Indiana laws and regulations\n   - Passing score: 75% (75 correct answers)\n\n2. **Practical Exam:** Hands-on demonstration\n   - Perform specific cuts and techniques on mannequin\n   - Demonstrate sanitation protocols\n   - Scored by licensed examiner\n   - Passing score: 75%\n\n**If you fail:**\n- You can retake the failed portion (written or practical)\n- Wait time: 30 days before retaking\n- Retake fee: $40 per attempt\n- No limit on number of attempts\n- Your apprenticeship hours remain valid\n\n**Pass rates:**\n- First-time pass rate: Approximately 85-90%\n- Most apprentices pass on first or second attempt\n- Your apprenticeship sponsor provides exam prep\n\n**Exam scheduling:**\n- Contact Indiana State Board: (317) 234-3040\n- Exams held monthly in Indianapolis\n- Schedule 4-6 weeks in advance\n- Bring photo ID and exam confirmation\n\n### Can I start my own shop right after getting licensed?\n\n**Technically yes, but it's not recommended.** You'll need business licenses, insurance, equipment, and startup capital. Most graduates work for a shop or rent a chair for 1-2 years before opening their own business.\n\n### Is this program only for people with funding?\n\n**No.** You can self-pay ($4,980) if you don't qualify for WIOA, WRG, or JRI funding. Employer sponsorship is also an option (employer pays the curriculum cost).\n\n### How many hours can I work per week?\n\n**Maximum hours per week (Indiana State Board guidelines):**\n\n**On-the-Job Training (OJT) at the shop:**\n- **Standard:** 40 hours/week (full-time)\n- **Maximum:** 50 hours/week (with overtime)\n- **Minimum:** 20 hours/week (part-time, takes longer to complete)\n\n**Related Technical Instruction (RTI):**\n- **Standard:** 3-4 hours/week (online or in-person)\n- **Can be completed:** Evenings, weekends, or during work hours\n\n**Total maximum per week:** 50 hours OJT + 4 hours RTI = **54 hours/week**\n\n**Why there's a maximum:**\n- ✅ Prevents burnout and ensures quality learning\n- ✅ Allows time for skill development (not just rushing through)\n- ✅ Federal labor laws limit work hours\n- ✅ Overtime pay required over 40 hours/week\n- ✅ State Board wants apprentices to learn properly, not just accumulate hours\n\n**Timeline based on hours per week:**\n\n**Full-time (40 hours/week):**\n- 2,000 hours ÷ 40 hours/week = 50 weeks\n- Plus 144 RTI hours over same period\n- **Total time: 12-13 months minimum**\n- **Realistic: 15-17 months** (accounting for holidays, sick days, shop closures)\n\n**Overtime (50 hours/week):**\n- 2,000 hours ÷ 50 hours/week = 40 weeks\n- Plus 144 RTI hours over same period\n- **Total time: 10-11 months minimum**\n- **Realistic: 12-14 months** (accounting for holidays, sick days)\n- **Note:** Employer must pay overtime (1.5x wage) for hours over 40/week\n\n**Part-time (20 hours/week):**\n- 2,000 hours ÷ 20 hours/week = 100 weeks\n- Plus 144 RTI hours over same period\n- **Total time: 24-26 months** (2+ years)\n\n**You cannot rush through faster than 10-11 months even working maximum hours.**\n\n### What if I have a criminal record?\n\n**You may still qualify.** Background checks are required, but many shops work with justice-involved individuals. JRI funding is specifically designed for people with criminal records. Be honest on your application.\n\n---\n\n## This Is Your Chance\n\n\"I was working dead-end jobs, barely making rent,\" Marcus says. \"I didn't think I had options. Then I found this program.

      "## IMPORTANT: Esthetician Apprenticeship Is Different from Barber Apprenticeship\n\n**Unlike the barber apprenticeship (which has House Bill 1135 and 1320), there is NO similar legislation for esthetician apprenticeships in Indiana.**\n\nEsthetician apprenticeships in Indiana follow **different rules** set by the Indiana Professional Licensing Agency and Indiana State Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners.\n\n---\n\n## How Esthetician Apprenticeship Works in Indiana\n\n### The Key Difference: School Partnership Required\n\n**Barber Apprenticeship:**\n- Shop can sponsor apprentice directly\n- 144 hours of theory can be done online\n- Shop handles all training\n\n**Esthetician Apprenticeship:**\n- ❌ Spa/salon CANNOT sponsor apprentice alone\n- ✅ Must partner with a licensed cosmetology school\n- ✅ School provides required classroom instruction\n- ✅ Spa/salon provides practical training\n- Split model: School + Workplace\n\n---\n\n## Indiana Esthetician Licensing Requirements\n\n**To become a licensed esthetician in Indiana, you must complete:**\n\n**Option 1: Traditional Cosmetology School**\n- 700 hours at a licensed cosmetology school\n- All instruction at the school\n- Graduate and take state board exam\n\n**Option 2: Apprenticeship (School + Spa Partnership)**\n- 700 hours total training\n- Split between licensed school and approved spa/salon\n- Typically: 350 hours classroom + 350 hours practical\n- Must be coordinated by licensed cosmetology school\n- Graduate and take state board exam\n\n---\n\n## Requirements for Esthetician Apprenticeship\n\n### For Students\n\n**You must:**\n- ✅ Be at least 17 years old (Indiana Code 25-8-3-3)\n- ✅ Have high school diploma or GED\n- ✅ Enroll in a licensed Indiana cosmetology school\n- ✅ School arranges apprenticeship placement with approved spa/salon\n- ✅ Complete 700 hours total (classroom + practical)\n- ✅ Pass Indiana State Board esthetician exam\n\n**You cannot:**\n- ❌ Start apprenticeship without school enrollment\n- ❌ Work at any spa/salon (must be school-approved)\n- ❌ Complete training without licensed instructor supervision\n\n---\n\n### For Spas/Salons (Program Holders)\n\n**To host esthetician apprentices, your spa/salon must:**\n\n**1. Partner with Licensed Cosmetology School**\n- ✅ Must have formal agreement with Indiana-licensed cosmetology school\n- ✅ School coordinates apprenticeship program\n- ✅ School provides curriculum and oversight\n- ✅ School tracks student hours\n- ✅ School certifies completion\n\n**2. Meet Facility Requirements**\n- ✅ Licensed by Indiana State Board of Cosmetology\n- ✅ Proper equipment for esthetician services\n- ✅ Sanitation and safety standards met\n- ✅ Adequate workspace for apprentice training\n\n**3. Have Licensed Supervision**\n- ✅ Must have licensed esthetician on staff with 2+ years experience\n- ✅ Licensed esthetician must supervise all apprentice work\n- ✅ Cannot leave apprentice unsupervised with clients\n\n**4. Follow School's Training Plan**\n- ✅ Provide practical training per school's curriculum\n- ✅ Track apprentice hours and report to school\n- ✅ Allow school inspections and oversight\n- ✅ Ensure apprentice meets competency standards\n\n---\n\n## The Process: Step-by-Step\n\n### Step 1: Enroll in Licensed Cosmetology School\n\n**You must start here:**\n- Find an Indiana-licensed cosmetology school that offers esthetician apprenticeship programs\n- Not all schools offer apprenticeship options (most do traditional 700-hour programs)\n- Enroll in their esthetician program\n- Pay tuition to the school (funding may be available through WIOA, WRG)\n\n**Schools that may offer apprenticeship options:**\n- Contact Indiana cosmetology schools directly\n- Ask: \"Do you offer esthetician apprenticeship programs with spa/salon partnerships?\"\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: School Arranges Apprenticeship Placement\n\n**The school (not you) coordinates:**\n- School has agreements with approved spas/salons\n- School matches you with a placement\n- School ensures spa/salon meets requirements\n- School creates training schedule (classroom + practical hours)\n\n**Typical split:**\n- 350 hours classroom instruction at school\n- 350 hours practical training at spa/salon\n- OR other combinations totaling 700 hours\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Complete Classroom Instruction\n\n**At the cosmetology school:**\n- Skin anatomy and physiology\n- Facial treatments and techniques\n- Hair removal (waxing, threading)\n- Makeup application\n- Sanitation and safety\n- Indiana laws and regulations\n- Client consultation\n- Business and ethics\n\n**Instruction must be provided by:**\n- Licensed cosmetology instructor\n- At licensed cosmetology school facility\n- Following Indiana-approved curriculum\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Complete Practical Training at Spa/Salon\n\n**At your apprenticeship placement:**\n- Work under supervision of licensed esthetician\n- Perform services on real clients\n- Practice techniques learned in school\n- Build skills and confidence\n- Earn money (if spa pays apprentices)\n\n**Supervision requirements:**\n- Licensed esthetician must be present\n- Apprentice cannot work alone with clients\n- All work must be supervised until licensed\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: School Certifies Completion\n\n**When you complete 700 hours:**\n- School verifies all hours (classroom + practical)\n- School submits completion documentation to Indiana State Board\n- You receive certificate of completion from school\n- You're eligible to take state board exam\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Take State Board Exam\n\n**Indiana State Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners:**\n- Written exam (theory, laws, safety)\n- Practical exam (demonstrate esthetician skills)\n- Passing score: 75%\n- Exam fee: Approximately $100-150\n\n**Once you pass:**\n- Apply for Indiana esthetician license\n- License fee: Approximately $50\n- Valid for 2 years\n- Renewable with continuing education\n\n---\n\n## Payment and Wages: The Critical Difference from Barber Apprenticeship\n\n### Barber Apprenticeship vs. Esthetician Apprenticeship Payment\n\n**BARBER APPRENTICESHIP (House Bill 1135/1320):**\n- ✅ You're an EMPLOYEE from day one\n- ✅ Shop pays you $10/hour + commissions + tips\n- ✅ You earn $20,000-$30,000 while training\n- ✅ Funding (WIOA/WRG/JRI) covers your RTI curriculum\n- ✅ You pay NOTHING for training\n- ✅ You graduate debt-free with money in your pocket\n\n**ESTHETICIAN APPRENTICESHIP (Traditional Cosmetology Rules):**\n- ❌ You're a STUDENT, not an employee (usually)\n- ❌ You pay tuition to the school ($5,000-$12,000)\n- ❌ Most spas don't pay you during training\n- ✅ Funding (WIOA/WRG) can cover tuition\n- ❌ You typically don't earn wages during training\n- ✅ You graduate with license but no earnings from training\n\n**This is the BIGGEST difference between the two programs.**\n\n---\n\n## Esthetician Apprenticeship Payment Scenarios\n\n### Scenario 1: Traditional Student Model (Most Common - 90% of programs)\n\n**How it works:**\n- You enroll in cosmetology school as a student\n- You pay tuition: $5,000-$12,000 for 700-hour program\n- School arranges your spa placement\n- You work at spa as part of your training\n- **Spa does NOT pay you wages**\n- You're gaining experience and completing required hours\n\n**Your costs:**\n- Tuition: $5,000-$12,000 (can be covered by WIOA/WRG)\n- Books and supplies: $500-$1,000\n- State board exam: $100-$150\n- License fee: $50\n\n**Your earnings during training:**\n- $0 from spa/salon\n- You may work another job to support yourself\n- Tips from clients (if spa allows): $0-$100/week\n\n**Example weekly schedule:**\n- Monday-Tuesday: Classroom at school (no pay)\n- Wednesday-Friday: Practical training at spa (no pay)\n- Saturday-Sunday: Work another job to pay bills\n\n**Total time:** 6-12 months depending on full-time or part-time\n\n**Financial outcome:**\n- Spent: $5,000-$12,000 (or $0 if funded)\n- Earned: $0 during training\n- After licensing: Earn $30,000-$50,000/year\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 2: Paid Apprenticeship Model (Rare - 5% of programs)\n\n**How it works:**\n- You enroll in cosmetology school as a student\n- You pay tuition: $5,000-$12,000\n- School arranges placement with spa that pays apprentices\n- **Spa pays you minimum wage ($7.25-$10/hour)**\n- You're both student AND employee\n\n**Your costs:**\n- Tuition: $5,000-$12,000 (can be covered by WIOA/WRG)\n- Books and supplies: $500-$1,000\n- State board exam: $100-$150\n- License fee: $50\n\n**Your earnings during training:**\n- Hourly wage: $7.25-$10/hour\n- 20-30 hours/week at spa = $145-$300/week\n- Tips from clients: $20-$50/week\n- **Total: $165-$350/week**\n\n**Example weekly schedule:**\n- Monday-Tuesday: Classroom at school (no pay)\n- Wednesday-Friday: Work at spa (get paid $8/hour)\n- 25 hours/week × $8 = $200/week\n- Over 6 months: $200 × 26 weeks = $5,200 earned\n\n**Financial outcome:**\n- Spent: $5,000-$12,000 tuition (or $0 if funded)\n- Earned: $5,000-$8,000 during training\n- After licensing: Earn $30,000-$50,000/year\n\n**Why this is rare:**\n- Most spas don't want to pay students who are still learning\n- Liability concerns (student mistakes)\n- Prefer to hire licensed estheticians\n\n---\n\n### Scenario 3: Work-Study or Tuition Offset Model (Very Rare - 5% of programs)\n\n**How it works:**\n- School partners with spa for special arrangement\n- Spa agrees to cover part or all of your tuition\n- You work at spa during training (unpaid or low wage)\n- In exchange, spa pays your school tuition\n\n**Your costs:**\n- Tuition: $0 (spa pays school directly)\n- Books and supplies: $500-$1,000\n- State board exam: $100-$150\n- License fee: $50\n\n**Your earnings during training:**\n- Hourly wage: $0-$7/hour (varies)\n- Tips from clients: $20-$50/week\n- **Total: $20-$100/week**\n\n**The trade-off:**\n- You don't pay tuition\n- But you also don't earn much during training\n- Spa invests in you with expectation you'll work there after licensing\n\n**Financial outcome:**\n- Spent: $0 tuition (spa covers)\n- Earned: $1,000-$3,000 during training\n- After licensing: Must work at spa for 1-2 years (typically)\n\n---\n\n## Side-by-Side Comparison: Barber vs. Esthetician Apprenticeship\n\n| Factor | Barber Apprenticeship | Esthetician Apprenticeship |\n|--------|----------------------|---------------------------|\n| **Legislation** | House Bill 1135 & 1320 | Traditional cosmetology rules |\n| **School Required?** | No (shop can sponsor directly) | Yes (must partner with school) |\n| **Your Status** | Employee | Student (usually) |\n| **Wages During Training** | $10/hour + commissions + tips | Usually $0 (student model) |\n| **Tuition Cost** | $0 (funding covers RTI) | $5,000-$12,000 (can be funded) |\n| **Earnings During Training** | $20,000-$30,000 | $0-$8,000 (if paid model) |\n| **Training Hours** | 2,000 hours OJT + 144 RTI | 700 hours total |\n| **Training Duration** | 15-17 months | 6-12 months |\n| **Who Pays You** | Barbershop (employer) | Usually no one (you're student) |\n| **Commission on Services** | Yes (40-60%) | No (you're student) |\n| **Tips** | Yes (100%) | Maybe (if spa allows) |\n| **Booth Rent Option** | Yes (month 12+) | No (not until licensed) |\n| **Financial Outcome** | Graduate with $20k-$30k earned | Graduate with $0-$8k earned |\n| **Debt** | $0 (no tuition) | $0 if funded, $5k-$12k if not |\n\n---\n\n## Can Esthetician Apprentices Earn While They Learn?\n\n**Short answer: Usually no, but it depends on the spa and school arrangement.**\n\n### Why Most Esthetician Apprentices Don't Get Paid\n\n**1. You're a student, not an employee**\n- Cosmetology schools treat apprentices as students\n- Students pay tuition, they don't earn wages\n- This is standard in cosmetology education\n\n**2. Liability and insurance**\n- Spas are nervous about unlicensed students working on clients\n- Insurance may not cover student mistakes\n- Easier to have students observe and practice, not earn money\n\n**3. Shorter training period**\n- 700 hours vs. 2,000 hours for barbers\n- 6-12 months vs. 15-17 months\n- Spas see it as short-term training, not long-term employment\n\n**4. No legislation requiring payment**\n- Barber apprenticeship has laws requiring employment status\n- Esthetician apprenticeship has no such laws\n- Schools and spas follow traditional student model\n\n---\n\n## How to Find a PAID Esthetician Apprenticeship\n\n**If you want to earn while you learn, here's how:**\n\n**Step 1: Ask cosmetology schools directly**\n- \"Do you have any spa partners that pay apprentices?\"\n- \"Are there work-study or paid apprenticeship options?\"\n- \"Can I work part-time at the spa while training?\"\n\n**Step 2: Look for spas with apprenticeship programs**\n- Some high-end spas invest in training their own estheticians\n- They may pay minimum wage during training\n- In exchange, you commit to working there after licensing\n\n**Step 3: Negotiate with the spa**\n- If school places you at a spa, ask about payment\n- \"Is there any compensation during my apprenticeship?\"\n- \"Can I earn tips from clients I serve?\"\n- Some spas may offer small stipend or tip-sharing\n\n**Step 4: Consider hybrid approach**\n- Work part-time at another job while doing apprenticeship\n- Do apprenticeship part-time (takes longer but you can work)\n- Save money before starting program\n\n---\n\n## Funding Options to Cover Tuition\n\n**The instructional portion (classroom hours at cosmetology school) can be 100% funded through WIOA or Workforce Ready Grant.**\n\n### WIOA Funding (Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act)\n\n**Who qualifies:**\n- Low-income adults\n- Dislocated workers\n- Youth ages 16-24\n\n**What WIOA covers for esthetician apprenticeship:**\n- ✅ Full tuition for 700-hour esthetician program ($5,000-$12,000)\n- ✅ Books and supplies\n- ✅ State board exam fees\n- ✅ License application fee\n- ✅ Support services (transportation, childcare if eligible)\n\n**What WIOA does NOT cover:**\n- ❌ Your wages at spa/salon (most spas don't pay apprentices)\n- ❌ Your living expenses during training\n\n**How it works:**\n1.

$20,000-$30,000 while training\n- No tuition cost\n- Graduate debt-free with money saved\n\n**Esthetician Apprenticeship:**\n- You're a student paying $5,000-$12,000 tuition (or $0 with funding)\n- Usually no wages during training\n- Graduate with license but no earnings from training\n\n**Why the difference?**\n- Barber apprenticeship has specific legislation (HB 1135/1320)\n- Esthetician apprenticeship follows traditional cosmetology education model\n- Until similar legislation passes for estheticians, this is how it works\n\n**Our recommendation:**\n- Apply for WIOA or Workforce Ready Grant to cover tuition\n- Look for paid apprenticeship opportunities (rare but exist)\n- Work part-time while training to support yourself\n- Focus on getting licensed quickly, then earn good money as licensed esthetician\n\n---\n\n## Funding Options\n\n**Tuition for 700-hour esthetician program:**\n- Typically $5,000-$12,000 depending on school\n- Apprenticeship programs may cost less

estheticians\n- ❌ No standalone esthetician apprenticeship without school\n- ✅ Apprenticeship must be coordinated by licensed cosmetology school\n- ✅ School + spa partnership model is the only option\n\n**Advocacy efforts:**\n- Some industry groups are working toward legislation similar to barber apprenticeship\n- No bills currently pending\n- Until legislation passes, school partnership is required\n\n---\n\n## How We Can Help\n\n**For Students:**\n- Connect you with cosmetology schools offering apprenticeship programs\n- Help you apply for WIOA or Workforce Ready Grant funding\n- Provide career counseling and support\n\n**For Spas/Salons:**\n- Connect you with cosmetology schools seeking spa partners\n- Help you understand requirements for hosting apprentices\n- Provide

apprenticeship?\"\n\n**Because Indiana law is different for estheticians.**\n- Barber apprenticeship has specific legislation (HB 1135, HB 1320)\n- Esthetician apprenticeship follows older cosmetology rules\n- Cosmetology rules require licensed school involvement\n- Until new legislation passes, school partnership is required\n\n### \"Can I work at a spa and count those hours toward my license?\"\n\n**No, not without school enrollment.**\n- Hours only count if you're enrolled in licensed cosmetology school\n- School must coordinate and verify your hours\n- Working at a spa without school enrollment doesn't count\n\n### \"Do I have to go to school full-time?\"\n\n**Depends on the school's apprenticeship program.**\n- Some schools offer part-time apprenticeship options\n- You attend school part-time + work at spa part-time\n- Takes longer but allows you to work\n- Ask schools about their apprenticeship schedules\n\n### \"Can I transfer hours from another state?\"\n\n**Maybe, depends on the state.**\n- Contact Indiana State Board of Cosmetology\n- Submit transcripts from your previous school\n- Board evaluates and approves eligible hours\n- You complete remaining hours in Indiana\n\n---\n\n## Contact Information\n\n**Indiana State Board of Cosmetology and Barber Examiners**\n- Phone: (317) 234-3040\n- Address: 402 W. Washington St., Room W072, Indianapolis, IN 46204\n- Website: [in.gov/pla/professions/cosmetology-board](https://www.in.gov/pla/professions/cosmetology-board/)\n\n**For questions about esthetician apprenticeship, ask:**\n- \"Which cosmetology schools offer esthetician apprenticeship programs?\"\n- \"What are the requirements for spa/salon partnerships?\"\n- \"How do I transfer hours from another state?\"\n\n---\n\n**Bottom Line:** Esthetician apprenticeship in Indiana requires partnership with a licensed cosmetology school. You cannot do it independently like the barber apprenticeship.",
