🚨 CRITICAL: Vercel Deployment Not Updating

PROBLEM:
- Latest code pushed to GitHub (commit: 4307756d)
- Vercel is still serving old cached version
- /lms/dashboard returns "Access denied" instead of new dashboard
- Proxy middleware was blocking /lms routes (NOW FIXED in code)

ROOT CAUSE:
- Vercel may be using stale deployment
- CDN cache not clearing
- Build may have failed silently

WHAT WAS FIXED IN CODE:
✅ Removed /lms from proxy.ts matcher
✅ Added .vercelignore for clean builds
✅ Updated vercel.json with explicit commands
✅ Fixed all deprecated packages
✅ Build succeeds locally (npm run build ✓)

WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find the fix2 project
3. Check latest deployment status
4. If failed: Read error logs and fix
5. If successful but not live: Promote to production
6. If old deployment: Click "Redeploy" with cache OFF
7. Clear Vercel CDN cache if option exists

VERIFICATION:
After deployment succeeds, test:
curl -sL https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/lms/dashboard

Should return HTML with "Welcome back" NOT {"error":"Access denied"}

LATEST COMMITS:
- 4307756d: Fix proxy to allow /lms access
- 53a6d486: Add .vercelignore
- c1093b54: Update vercel.json
- bfa3a9ac: Force deployment
- e7038d23: Fix build errors

ALL CODE IS READY - JUST NEEDS VERCEL TO DEPLOY IT

⏰ URGENT: Site has been broken for hours
📊 Impact: Users cannot access new student dashboard
