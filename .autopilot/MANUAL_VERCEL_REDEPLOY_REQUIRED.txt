🚨 CRITICAL: VERCEL AUTO-DEPLOY IS BROKEN

PROBLEM:
- Code is pushed to GitHub (commit: 20eff05b)
- Vercel is NOT auto-deploying
- Site still shows old code from days ago
- Multiple commits pushed, none deployed

PROOF:
- Latest commit: 20eff05b "CRITICAL: Add visual markers"
- Dashboard should show RED heading "NEW BUILD DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY"
- Dashboard should show YELLOW warning box
- Currently shows OLD complex dashboard with imports

ROOT CAUSE:
Vercel auto-deploy from GitHub is disabled or broken

SOLUTION - MANUAL STEPS REQUIRED:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
   https://vercel.com/dashboard

2. Find the fix2 project
   Click on it

3. Go to Settings → Git
   Check if "Auto Deploy" is enabled
   If disabled, enable it

4. Go to Deployments tab
   Click "Redeploy" button (top right)
   Select latest commit: 20eff05b
   UNCHECK "Use existing Build Cache"
   Click "Redeploy"

5. Wait 2-3 minutes for build

6. Test deployment:
   Visit: https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/lms/dashboard
   Should see RED heading "NEW BUILD DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY"
   Should see YELLOW box with checkmark
   Should see GREEN success box at bottom

VERIFICATION COMMAND:
curl -sL -A "Mozilla/5.0" https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/lms/dashboard | grep "NEW BUILD DEPLOYED"

Should return: <h1 style="color:#dc2626">🚀 NEW BUILD DEPLOYED SUCCESSFULLY</h1>
