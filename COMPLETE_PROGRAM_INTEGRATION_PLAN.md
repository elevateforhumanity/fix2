## 🚀 Recommendation:

Since this is a lot of work, I suggest:

**Option A: Do it all at once** (3-4 hours)
- I create all 15 program pages
- Update all data files
- Fix all issues
- Deploy everything

**Option B: Prioritize top programs** (1 hour)
- Create pages for your top 5-7 most important programs
- Fix buttons and admin access
- Add remaining programs later

**Option C: Use your SQL data** (30 minutes)
- Import programs directly from your SQL file into the database
- Create a dynamic program page that reads from database
- No need for individual pages

**Which option do you prefer?**
