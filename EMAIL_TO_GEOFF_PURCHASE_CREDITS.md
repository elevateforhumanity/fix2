**Subject:** Purchase 25 HSI RSV Credits - Ready to Start Enrolling

---

Hi Geoff,

Thank you for the pricing information and course catalog access! We've reviewed everything and are ready to start enrolling students.

**We'd like to purchase:**
- 25 RSV credits to start
- Payment via: [credit terms OR credit card - choose one]

**Our Expected Usage:**
- Q1: 25-50 students (CPR/First Aid)
- Q2-Q4: 100-200 students
- Year 1 Total: 150-250 students

**Primary Programs:**
- Healthcare (CNA, Medical Assistant) - First Aid + CPR/AED (All Ages)
- HVAC Technician - CPR/AED (Adult)
- CDL Truck Driving - CPR/AED (Adult)
- All workforce programs - Various courses

**Questions:**
1. What's the total cost for 25 RSV credits?
2. How do we track our credit balance?
3. What are the volume discount tiers? (50, 100, 250 credits)
4. Can we set up automatic credit refills when balance is low?
5. What's the turnaround time for credit activation?

**Next Steps:**
Once credits are activated, we'll begin enrolling students immediately using the RSV links you provided.

We're also interested in adding 50-100 online safety training courses from the catalog (http://store.osmanager4.com/emss/groups/523). Can we discuss pricing for those as well?

Thank you for your support!

Best regards,
