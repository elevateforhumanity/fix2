## KEY MESSAGES BY AUDIENCE

### For Investors

**Message:** "Functional MVP with differentiated compliance automation. Needs pilot validation before scale funding. 5-10x return potential if executed well."

**Documents to Emphasize:**

- `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` (verdict: 6.1/10)
- `INDEPENDENT_EVALUATION_REPORT.md` (technical credibility: 8/10)
- `GAPS_AND_PROOF_POINTS.md` (5 months to fundable)

---

### For Grant Reviewers

**Message:** "Aligns with WIOA priorities, addresses real need, but lacks track record. Recommend pilot funding ($50K-$100K) with milestones before full funding."

**Documents to Emphasize:**

- `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` (mission alignment)
- `INDIANA_COMPLIANCE_SUMMARY.md` (compliance depth)
- `SUPPORTING_EVIDENCE_PACKAGE.md` (501(c)(3) status)

---

### For Potential Partners

**Message:** "Low-risk pilot opportunity. Platform is functional, compliance is automated, but we need operational proof. Free 3-month trial, month-to-month after."

**Documents to Emphasize:**

- `EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md` (what exists)
- `EVIDENCE_INVENTORY.md` (implemented features)
- `GAPS_AND_PROOF_POINTS.md` (pilot plan)

---

## WHAT REVIEWERS WILL ASK

### Question 1: "Is this real or just an idea?"

**Answer:** "It's real. 569 components, 284 database migrations, 18,691 bytes of compliance code. Deployed to production. But no live users yet."

**Evidence:** `EVIDENCE_INVENTORY.md`, code repository

---

### Question 2: "Why should we fund/partner with you?"

**Answer:** "Automated Indiana DWD compliance is rare and valuable. We've built it. We need pilot partners to prove it works."

**Evidence:** `INDIANA_COMPLIANCE_SUMMARY.md`, platform demo

---

### Question 3: "What's your biggest risk?"

**Answer:** "Single founder with no operational proof. We're addressing this by recruiting pilot partners and seeking funding to hire a team."

**Evidence:** `GAPS_AND_PROOF_POINTS.md`, `INDEPENDENT_EVALUATION_REPORT.md`

---

### Question 4: "How long until you're fundable/scalable?"

**Answer:** "5 months. 1 week to deploy automation, 4 weeks for legal validation, 12 weeks for pilot, 2 weeks to document results."

**Evidence:** `GAPS_AND_PROOF_POINTS.md` (critical path)

---

### Question 5: "What makes this innovative?"

**Answer:** "Novel configuration of MOU-based credential sharing + automated compliance. Not revolutionary, but differentiated and not available off-the-shelf."

**Evidence:** `INDEPENDENT_EVALUATION_REPORT.md` (innovation assessment)
