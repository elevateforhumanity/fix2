## ✅ CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Hero Banner - IMPROVED ✅

- **Larger heading**: `text-4xl...lg:text-7xl` → `text-5xl...lg:text-8xl` (more impact)

- **Bigger gaps**: `gap-12 lg:gap-16 xl:gap-24` → `gap-16 lg:gap-20 xl:gap-28`

### 2. Middle Section - ALREADY GOOD ✅

**Current State**:
The "What we do" section was already redesigned and doesn't have the 3 images I was looking for. It has:
- Centered content
- 4 small info cards (earn while you learn, funded pathways, etc.)
- 4 larger feature cards (training, funding, support, portals)
- Clean, modern layout

**No changes needed** - this section is already well-designed!

### 3. Overall Layout - IMPROVED ✅

**Background**:
- Changed from `bg-slate-950 text-white` to `bg-white` (cleaner)

**Spacing**:
- More whitespace throughout
- Better gaps between elements
- Improved visual hierarchy
