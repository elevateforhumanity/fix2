# DUAL LICENSING MODEL

## Two Paths to Market

**Date:** December 26, 2024  
**Purpose:** Clarify the two distinct licensing options

---

## OVERVIEW

The platform offers **two primary licensing models** that serve different market segments:

1. **Program Holder Network** - WITH credentials (MOU-based)
2. **Independent Platform** - WITHOUT credentials (white-label)

This dual approach addresses two distinct customer needs and expands total addressable market.

---

## MODEL 1: PROGRAM HOLDER NETWORK (WITH CREDENTIALS)

### Target Market

- Small nonprofits without ETPL credentials
- Community organizations wanting to offer workforce training
- Organizations that can't afford credential application process
- Groups wanting to avoid compliance burden

### Value Proposition

**"Wrap around your existing business. Add credentials, technology, and compliance automation. Keep everything else the same."**

**Key Message:** We enhance your existing operations, we don't replace them.

### What They Get

✅ Access to master ETPL credentials  
✅ WIOA eligibility for students  
✅ WorkOne partnership access  
✅ Workforce Ready Grant eligibility  
✅ Platform (LMS, student management, reporting)  
✅ **Automated compliance monitoring**  
✅ **Automated Indiana DWD reporting**  
✅ Technical support

### What They Give

- Monthly licensing fee ($2K-$15K based on size)
- Student data (for compliance reporting)
- Operational control (must follow MOU policies)
- Brand association (operate under master credentials)

### Pricing Tiers

- **Small** (1-50 students): $2,000/month
- **Medium** (51-150 students): $5,000/month
- **Large** (151-300 students): $10,000/month
- **Enterprise** (301+ students): $15,000/month

### Key Differentiator

**Automated compliance system** - Progressive alerts, batch processing, automatic enforcement

### Market Size

- **Target:** 500-1,000 small nonprofits in Indiana
- **Realistic:** 50-100 in first 3 years
- **Revenue Potential:** $1.2M-$12M annually at scale

---

## MODEL 2: INDEPENDENT PLATFORM (WITHOUT CREDENTIALS)

### Target Market

- Existing ETPL providers with their own credentials
- Organizations that already have WIOA approval
- Training providers wanting better technology
- Groups that want full operational control

### Value Proposition

**"Wrap around your existing business. Add modern technology. Keep your credentials and full control."**

**Key Message:** We provide the technology infrastructure, you keep everything else.

### What They Get

✅ White-label platform (your branding)  
✅ Complete LMS (course creation, student management)  
✅ Mobile app (iOS + Android)  
✅ Reporting tools  
✅ Technical support  
✅ Custom domain  
✅ Branded emails & certificates

### What They DON'T Get

❌ No credentials (you use your own)  
❌ No compliance automation (you handle it)  
❌ No Indiana DWD reporting (you do it manually)  
❌ No MOU restrictions (full independence)

### Pricing Tiers

- **Starter** (1-100 students): $2,000/month
- **Growth** (101-300 students): $5,000/month
- **Scale** (301-1,000 students): $10,000/month

### Key Differentiator

**Instant access** - No approval process, no MOU, no waiting

### Market Size

- **Target:** 200-300 existing ETPL providers in Indiana
- **Realistic:** 20-30 in first 3 years
- **Revenue Potential:** $480K-$3.6M annually at scale

## STRATEGIC RATIONALE

### Why Offer Both?

**1. Expands Total Addressable Market**

- Program Holder Network: 500-1,000 potential customers
- Independent Platform: 200-300 potential customers
- Total: 700-1,300 potential customers

**2. Reduces Customer Acquisition Risk**

- If credential-sharing model faces legal challenges, Independent Platform continues
- If compliance automation fails, Independent Platform is unaffected
- Two revenue streams, not one

**3. Serves Different Customer Needs**

- Some want credentials (Program Holder Network)
- Some want technology (Independent Platform)
- Both are valid, both are profitable

**4. Competitive Positioning**

- Program Holder Network: No direct competitors (novel model)
- Independent Platform: Competes with traditional LMS (Bridge, Absorb, etc.)
- Dual model creates unique positioning

---

## MARKET VALIDATION

### Program Holder Network (WITH Credentials)

**Demand Indicators:**

- 40+ stakeholder meetings
- Many small nonprofits lack ETPL credentials
- Compliance burden is real pain point
- Government funding available (WIOA)

**Validation Needed:**

- Legal opinion (can you sub-license credentials?)
- Indiana DWD confirmation
- Pilot results (3-5 partners)

### Independent Platform (WITHOUT Credentials)

**Demand Indicators:**

- Existing ETPL providers use outdated technology
- Many pay $10K-$50K/year for commercial LMS
- White-label demand is proven (SaaS model)
- No approval process = faster sales cycle

**Validation Needed:**

- Customer interviews (5-10 existing ETPL providers)
- Pricing validation (is $2K-$10K competitive?)
- Feature comparison (do we have feature parity?)

---

## SALES STRATEGY

### Program Holder Network

**Sales Cycle:** 3-6 months (longer due to MOU)

**Process:**

1. Stakeholder meeting (identify need)
2. Application (5-step form)
3. Review & approval (2-4 weeks)
4. MOU negotiation (1-2 weeks)
5. Onboarding (2-4 weeks)
6. Go-live

**Key Objections:**

- "Can you legally share credentials?" (need legal validation)
- "What if you lose your credentials?" (risk mitigation plan)
- "What if we want to leave?" (exit clause in MOU)

### Independent Platform

**Sales Cycle:** 1-2 months (faster, no approval)

**Process:**

1. Demo (30 minutes)
2. Trial (14-30 days)
3. Contract (month-to-month or annual)
4. Onboarding (1-2 weeks)
5. Go-live

**Key Objections:**

- "Why not just use [competitor]?" (feature comparison)
- "Can you integrate with our systems?" (API documentation)
- "What about support?" (support plan)
