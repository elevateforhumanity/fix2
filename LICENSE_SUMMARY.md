# Elevate For Humanity - License Summary

**Plain-Language Protection Overview**

This summary explains the rules that protect the Elevate Workforce Platform, the multi-app codebase, and all related intellectual property. The full legal agreement will include these terms in more formal language, but this is the human-centered version.

---

## 1. What You Are Licensing

When you license the Elevate Workforce Platform, you are receiving:

- A **non-exclusive, non-transferable license** to use the Elevate multi-app codebase
- For **your organization only**, unless otherwise stated in your contract
- With the right to **deploy, customize, and operate** the platform for your programs, staff, students, and partners

**You do not receive ownership of the intellectual property.**
The codebase remains owned by Elevate For Humanity (EFH).

---

## 2. What You Cannot Do

To protect the platform and prevent misuse, licensees may not:

### 🚫 Resell or Repackage the Platform

You cannot:
- Resell the software
- Offer it as your own LMS
- Create a competing product built on this code
- Advertise the platform as a product for sale or licensing to others

### 🚫 Share, Publish, or Redistribute the Code

You cannot:
- Share your access
- Give the code to contractors outside your organization without written approval
- Upload or store the code in public repositories
- Send, copy, or fork the repo into any unauthorized system

### 🚫 Use the Codebase for Multiple Organizations (unless licensed)

**A Single-Org License means:**
- You may use the platform internally
- You may not resell, sublicense, or operate it as a white-label service

**A White-Label License** explicitly allows multiple orgs — but ONLY within the scope defined in your contract.

---

## 3. How EFH Protects Its IP

To ensure the platform is never misused or resold:

### ✔ Fingerprinting / License ID

Each licensed codebase includes a unique license identifier embedded into:
- Configuration files
- Internal metadata
- Non-critical system constants

This helps EFH trace unauthorized copies.

### ✔ Private Repository Delivery

Every client receives:
- Their own private repo
- Their own license ID
- Restricted access

EFH never gives access to the core internal monorepo.

### ✔ Contractual Enforcement

Your signed agreement includes:
- Breach clauses
- Termination rights
- Damages
- Audit rights (only if misuse is suspected)

These protect both EFH and compliant licensees.

---

## 4. What You Are Allowed To Do

Within your license level (Single-Org, White-Label Partner, or Full Acquisition), you CAN:

- ✅ Fully deploy the platform for your organization
- ✅ Customize visuals, content, branding, and workflows
- ✅ Integrate it with your internal tools
- ✅ Use it for learners, providers, staff, and workforce partners
- ✅ Build new features unique to your needs
- ✅ Host it on your infrastructure or EFH-recommended hosting

**You get full freedom of use within your licensed scope.**

---

## 5. What a White-Label License Allows

A White-Label partner may:
- Operate multiple instances
- Serve multiple training providers or schools
- Offer the platform as a managed service within a defined region or market

But they still cannot:
- Resell source code
- Expand beyond their allowed territory or audience
- Rebrand the system for resale without EFH approval

---

## 6. Full Codebase Acquisition

If you purchase the full acquisition license, you receive:
- Permanent rights to the codebase
- The ability to build on top of it
- Exclusive ownership of your version

BUT EFH retains rights to:
- Prior versions
- EFH-branded versions
- Future improvements (unless otherwise negotiated)

**Acquisition = freedom to operate, NOT exclusive global ownership of EFH's IP.**

---

## 7. In Case of Misuse

If a licensee:
- Resells the platform
- Shares code
- Forks it into a competing product
- Launches it outside their licensed scope

EFH may:
- Suspend license access
- Terminate the agreement
- Seek damages
- Require removal of unauthorized deployments

This ensures the platform remains protected for all legitimate partners.

## ⭐ Short Version for Website Display

> **License Summary:**
> You are licensing the Elevate multi-app workforce platform for your organization's use. You may deploy, customize, and operate the system for your programs — but you may not resell, repackage, redistribute, or offer the platform as your own product.
>
> Every delivery includes a unique license ID and private code repository. Unauthorized resale or distribution is prohibited and may trigger termination and legal remedies.
>
> White-label partners have expanded permissions within their contract. Full codebase acquisition grants operational ownership of your version but does not eliminate EFH's underlying IP rights.
