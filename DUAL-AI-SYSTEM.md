## 📝 Example PR Comments

### 1. GPT-4 Code Review

```markdown
# 🤖 AI Code Review by GPT-4

## GPT-4 Analysis

The changes look solid. A few suggestions:

1. **Type Safety**: Add explicit return type to `handleSubmit`
2. **Error Handling**: Wrap async call in try-catch
3. **Performance**: Use `useCallback` to prevent re-renders

Overall: Good code quality, minor improvements suggested.
```

### 2. GPT-4 Security Scan

```markdown
# 🔒 AI Security Analysis by GPT-4

## Security Analysis

**No Critical Issues Found**

Recommendations:

- Add input length validation (line 23)
- Consider rate limiting on auth endpoint
- Rotate JWT secret regularly

Good practices observed: Input sanitization, HTTPS enforced
```

### 3. GPT-4 Performance Analysis

```markdown
# ⚡ AI Performance Analysis by GPT-4

## Performance Analysis

Potential Issues:

1. O(n²) complexity in nested loop (lines 67-72)
2. Memory leak: Event listener not cleaned up
3. Bundle size: Full lodash import

Optimizations: Memoize calculation, debounce API calls
```

### 4. Claude Security Expert

```markdown
# 🔒 Deep Security Analysis by Claude

## Claude's Security Assessment

### Critical Issues

None detected ✅

### High Priority

1. **SQL Injection Risk** (line 45): User input directly in query
   - Fix: Use parameterized queries
   - Example: `db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId])`

2. **XSS Vulnerability** (line 89): Unescaped user content
   - Fix: Sanitize before rendering
   - Use: DOMPurify or similar

### Medium Priority

- Add CSRF tokens to forms
- Implement rate limiting (100 req/min recommended)

### Best Practices Observed

✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
✅ JWT with proper expiration
✅ CORS correctly configured
```

### 5. Claude Code Quality Analyst

````markdown
# 🤖 Code Quality Analysis by Claude

## Claude's Code Quality Assessment

### Excellent Practices

✅ Clean separation of concerns
✅ Proper TypeScript usage
✅ Good component composition
✅ Comprehensive error handling

### Suggestions

1. **Extract Custom Hook**: Form logic could be reusable
   ```typescript
   const useFormSubmit = (onSubmit) => {
     // Extract form logic here
   };
   ```
````

2. **Improve Testability**: Inject dependencies
3. **Add JSDoc**: Document complex functions

### Refactoring Ideas

- Consider using React Query for data fetching
- Split large component into smaller ones
- Add unit tests for business logic

Overall: Well-structured code with room for minor improvements.

## 🔐 Setup

### 1. Add Anthropic API Key to GitHub Secrets

You already hooked Anthropic to GitHub! Just verify:

```bash
# Check if secret exists
gh secret list | grep ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
````

If not set, add it:

```bash
gh secret set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --body "your-key-here"
```

### 2. Verify OpenAI Key (Already Done)

```bash
gh secret list | grep OPENAI_API_KEY
```

### 3. Test the System

```bash
# Create a test PR
git checkout -b test/dual-ai
echo "// Test dual AI" >> src/App.tsx
git add .
git commit -m "Test: Dual AI system"
git push origin test/dual-ai
gh pr create --title "Test Dual AI" --body "Testing GPT-4 + Claude"
