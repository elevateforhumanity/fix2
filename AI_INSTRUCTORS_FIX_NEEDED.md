# AI INSTRUCTORS - PHOTOS NEEDED

## Issue
AI instructor page shows placeholder icons instead of professional instructor photos.

## What's Needed
Professional headshot photos for AI instructors in each program category:

### Required Photos (300x300px, professional headshots):

1. **instructor-barber.jpg** - Male barber instructor
2. **instructor-beauty.jpg** - Female beauty/esthetics instructor  
3. **instructor-health.jpg** - Healthcare professional (medical scrubs)
4. **instructor-tech.jpg** - IT/Tech professional
5. **instructor-business.jpg** - Business professional
6. **instructor-trades.jpg** - Skilled trades instructor
7. **instructor-default.jpg** - Generic professional instructor

## Where to Place
`/public/images/team/instructors/`

## Temporary Solution
Using AI-generated professional instructor avatars or stock photos from:
- Unsplash (search: "professional instructor", "teacher portrait")
- Generated via DALL-E or Midjourney
- Professional headshot stock photos

## SQL to Run After Adding Photos
Run: `/workspaces/fix2/FIX_AI_INSTRUCTORS_AND_SITE.sql`

## Current Status
❌ No instructor photos - showing placeholder icons
❌ Needs professional headshots added
❌ SQL script ready to assign photos to instructors
