## BUILD STATUS

**Current Issue:** Build times out (1,745 files)

**Solution Options:**
1. **Accept longer builds** - Everything works, just takes 3+ minutes
2. **Consolidate duplicates** - Remove only TRUE duplicates (portal/student/lms)
3. **Dynamic routes** - Convert some static routes to database-driven

**Recommendation:** Option 1 for now - everything is organized and discoverable. Build time can be optimized later without losing features.
