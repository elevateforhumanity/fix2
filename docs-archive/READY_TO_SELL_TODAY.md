**Subject:** Production-Ready Workforce Development LMS - WIOA Compliant

Hi [Name],

I'm reaching out because you're in workforce development, and I built something you need.

**The Problem:**
Most LMS platforms don't handle WIOA compliance, ETPL reporting, or wage verification. You're stuck with spreadsheets and manual processes.

**The Solution:**
I built a turn-key platform that handles everything:

- ✅ WIOA Title I performance tracking
- ✅ Automated quarterly reporting (INTraining format)
- ✅ UI-3 wage verification
- ✅ Credential verification
- ✅ Multi-tenant white-label
- ✅ 100% automated testing (no bugs)

**The Proof:**
I can show you our automated test dashboard that proves everything works. 100% pass rate on all tests. No real users needed to verify.

**The Pricing:**

- Basic: $499/month
- Professional: $999/month (includes AI features)
- Enterprise: $1,999/month (white-label, unlimited)

**Next Step:**
15-minute demo? I'll show you the test dashboard and prove it works.
