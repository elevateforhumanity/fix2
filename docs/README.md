# Elevate for Humanity – Documentation Home

This folder replaces the chaos of 200+ loose markdown files in the project root.

## Structure

- `docs/current/` – Active docs that are still in use
- `docs/archive/` – Old / historical docs you want to keep but not surface
- `docs/deployment/` – Deployment, hosting, DNS, CI/CD, environment config
- `docs/development/` – Local setup, contribution guides, architecture notes

## How to Use

- When you write a new doc for staff or developers, put it in the right folder.
- When something goes out of date, move it to `docs/archive/`.
- The admin page `/admin/site-health` summarizes what's left before launch.
