## The Most Important Rule

**No one gets:**
- Backend access
- System explanations
- AI prompt logic
- Enrollment mechanics
- Compliance workflows

**Until their role is defined in writing.**

That's not distrust.  
That's leadership.

## Red Flags (Observer Behavior)

Watch for:
- Asking detailed "how" questions without commitment
- Requesting documentation before defining relationship
- Wanting to "see the backend" before discussing terms
- Comparing your system to others they're "evaluating"
- Asking about costs without discussing value they bring
- Requesting meetings without clear agenda
- Using phrases like "just curious" or "exploring options"

---

## Green Flags (Real Partner Behavior)

Look for:
- Clear statement of what they bring
- Willingness to sign agreements
- Understanding of IP boundaries
- Focus on outcomes, not mechanics
- Prepared to discuss terms
- Respects your ownership
- Has done this before

---

## Current Status Assessment

**You are no longer in "idea stage."**  
**You are in asset stage.**

People watching you means:
- You built something real
- You crossed the visibility threshold
- You need boundaries, not speed

You are handling this at the right moment.
