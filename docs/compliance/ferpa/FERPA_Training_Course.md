## Module 9: Case Studies

### Case Study 1: Parent Request

**Scenario:** A parent calls requesting their 20-year-old daughter's grades.

**Question:** Should you provide the information?

**Answer:** No. Students 18+ or in postsecondary education have FERPA rights. Parent needs written consent from student or must qualify for an exception (e.g., student is dependent for tax purposes AND institution has policy allowing disclosure).

**Action:** Politely explain FERPA rights transfer to student. Suggest parent contact student directly.

---

### Case Study 2: Public Grade Posting

**Scenario:** An instructor wants to post grades on the classroom wall using student ID numbers.

**Question:** Is this permitted?

**Answer:** No. Even using ID numbers, students can identify themselves and potentially others. This is a public disclosure without consent.

**Action:** Instructor must use LMS gradebook or provide grades individually.

---

### Case Study 3: Workforce Partner Request

**Scenario:** A WIOA partner requests completion data for all students in a program.

**Question:** Can you provide this information?

**Answer:** Depends. Aggregate, de-identified data may be shared. Individual student data requires consent or data sharing agreement.

**Action:** Verify data sharing agreement is in place. Provide only aggregate data or obtain student consent for individual records.

---

### Case Study 4: Media Inquiry

**Scenario:** A reporter asks for names of students on the Dean's List.

**Question:** Can you provide the names?

**Answer:** Only if Dean's List is defined as directory information AND students have not opted out.

**Action:** Verify directory information policy. Check opt-out list. Provide only names of students who have not opted out.

---

### Case Study 5: Emergency Situation

**Scenario:** A student threatens self-harm. Campus police request the student's schedule and emergency contact.

**Question:** Can you disclose this information?

**Answer:** Yes. Health and safety emergency exception applies.

**Action:** Disclose only information necessary to address emergency. Document disclosure and circumstances.
