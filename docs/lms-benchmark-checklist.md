## 2. What to Compare Visually (Design & Layout)

For each vendor, capture:

- **Sub-headline** (who it helps: employees, partners, customers, schools)
- **Primary CTA buttons** (e.g., "Get a demo", "Start free", "Talk to sales")
- **Hero visuals** (screenshots, people, dashboards, icons)

> ✏️ **Action for Elevate:**  
> Rewrite Elevate's hero to:
>
> - State clearly: "Workforce training & apprenticeships for [city/region]."
> - Call out: DOL-registered apprenticeships, ETPL/WRG/WorkOne alignment.
> - Include 1–2 CTAs: "Apply as a Student" and "Partner With Elevate".

### 2.2 Navigation menu & page structure

Document how each LMS structures the top menu:

- Common sections (e.g., Solutions, Products, Customers, Resources, Pricing)
- Where they put **"Compliance" / "Industries" / "Use Cases"**

### 2.3 Section layout & visual rhythm

For each vendor, note:

- How they break the page into **horizontal bands** (hero, benefits, features, use-cases, logos, testimonials)
- Use of **icons, screenshots, cards** to visually group content
- Consistency in spacing, fonts, and color usage

> ✏️ **Action for Elevate:**
>
> - Rebuild long walls of text into:
>   - 3-column benefit sections
