# Mobile Workflow Overview

This project now ships with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/) so the existing Vite/React web application can be packaged for iOS and Android without maintaining a separate codebase.

## Project Layout

- `capacitor.config.ts` – shared Capacitor configuration
- `android/` – Android Studio project generated by `pnpm exec cap add android`
- `ios/` – Xcode workspace generated by `pnpm exec cap add ios`

## Daily Tasks

1. **Make your web changes** (React/Tailwind/etc.).
2. **Build the web bundle**: `pnpm build`
3. **Sync native shells**: `pnpm mobile:sync`
4. **Open the target IDE** (Android Studio or Xcode) and build from there.

## Helpful Commands

| Script                | Description                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm mobile:copy`    | Copies the latest `dist/` assets into the native projects without re-running plugin updates. |
| `pnpm mobile:sync`    | Copies assets **and** runs plugin updates for both platforms.                                |
| `pnpm mobile:android` | Syncs assets and opens the Android Studio project.                                           |
| `pnpm mobile:ios`     | Syncs assets and opens the Xcode workspace.                                                  |

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- Android Studio Flamingo+ with the Android SDK installed
- Xcode 15+ with command-line tools (for macOS developers)
- Java 17 (required by the latest Android Gradle tools)
- CocoaPods (`brew install cocoapods`) if you plan to run iOS builds locally

## Tips

- The Capacitor CLI already lives in `devDependencies`, so `pnpm exec cap ...` works without global installs.
- When running inside CI or a container without Android Studio, use `pnpm mobile:copy` to generate artifacts for a downstream build step.
- If you add new Capacitor plugins, run `pnpm mobile:sync` afterwards so both native projects get the updated native code.
