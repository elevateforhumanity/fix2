## Positioning Strategy

### For RFPs and Sales Calls

**Opening:**

> "Elevate for Humanity has all the core LMS features you'd expect from Moodle, Docebo, or LearnWorlds — dashboards, courses, learning paths, certificates, reports — but we're purpose-built for workforce training programs."

**Differentiation:**

> "Where we're different is that we have program holder portals, delegate case management, and digital MOU workflows baked in from day one. The big LMS platforms would need months of custom development to support WRG, WIOA, JRI, and DOL programs the way we do."

**Roadmap:**

> "We're actively building interactive video, SCORM import, and course authoring tools. But even without those, we're already the only platform that gives you workforce enrollment, caseload tracking, and partner management out of the box."

---

## Video Script Recommendations

### 30-Second Elevator Pitch

> "Elevate for Humanity is a workforce-first LMS built for programs like WRG, WIOA, JRI, and DOL apprenticeships. We have everything you'd expect from Moodle or Docebo — courses, certificates, reports — plus program holder portals, case management, and digital MOUs that the big platforms don't offer. If you're running funded workforce training, Elevate is built for you."

### 60-Second Feature Overview

> "Elevate for Humanity brings together four portals in one platform:
>
> **Students** see their dashboard, courses, assignments, grades, and certificates.
>
> **Admins** manage training providers, review applications, run reports, and issue bulk certificates.
>
> **Program Holders** — like barbershops, CNA schools, and HVAC partners — apply online, sign their MOU digitally, and track their participants.
>
> **Delegates and case managers** see live caseload reports with On Track, At Risk, and Not Engaged status.
>
> We're adding interactive video, SCORM import, and course authoring soon. But right now, we're already the only LMS purpose-built for workforce training programs."

### 90-Second Competitive Comparison

> "If you've looked at Moodle, Docebo, or LearnWorlds, you know they're powerful platforms. Elevate for Humanity has the same core features — dashboards, courses, learning paths, certificates, reports — but we're different in three ways:
>
> **First**, we're built for funded workforce programs. WRG, WIOA, JRI, EmployIndy, DOL apprenticeships — we track them all.
>
> **Second**, we have program holder and delegate portals baked in. Training providers can apply, sign MOUs, and manage participants without you building custom workflows.
>
> **Third**, we focus on case management. Caseload reports, case notes, follow-ups — it's all built in.
>
> The big LMS platforms are great for selling courses. Elevate is built for workforce training and funding compliance. That's the difference."
