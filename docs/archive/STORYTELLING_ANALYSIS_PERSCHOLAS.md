---

## 1. HOMEPAGE STORYTELLING STRUCTURE

### Opening Hook

```
"Per Scholas is Unlocking Potential"
```

**Why it works:**

- ✅ Aspirational language ("Unlocking Potential")
- ✅ 30th anniversary badge (credibility)
- ✅ Video hero (emotional connection)
- ✅ Immediate human focus

### Dual Audience Approach

```
FOR LEARNERS:
"I want no-cost training for a competitive career in tech"
→ Achieve a thriving career through AI-enabled no-cost training

FOR BUSINESSES:
"I need to hire tech talent for my company"
→ Hire qualified candidates with the skills you need
```

**Why it works:**

- ✅ Speaks directly to user intent ("I want..." / "I need...")
- ✅ Clear benefit statements
- ✅ Separate paths for different audiences
- ✅ Action-oriented language

---

## 2. STORYTELLING TECHNIQUES

### A. Human Stories First

**Example 1: David Jarvis**

```
"When you are interviewing a Per Scholas graduate, you already have
someone who is committed and prepared for the work world and responsible
for their time and availability."
```

**Why it works:**

- ✅ Real person with photo
- ✅ Employer perspective (credibility)
- ✅ Specific qualities mentioned
- ✅ Link to full story

**Example 2: Joovay Arias**

```
"I peaked in my previous career and was ready for a change. I have always
loved computer science but thought it was just for college kids out in
California. But if you study hard, you can make it!"
```

**Why it works:**

- ✅ Relatable struggle ("peaked in previous career")
- ✅ Overcomes objection ("thought it was just for college kids")
- ✅ Empowering message ("you can make it!")
- ✅ Authentic voice

### B. Data-Driven Credibility

**Specific Numbers Used:**

- "30,000+ graduates" (scale)
- "85% graduation rate" (quality)
- "80%+ find employment within one year" (outcomes)
- "$20,085 → $54,606" (income transformation)
- "1000+ employers hire graduates" (demand)
- "20+ locations nationwide" (reach)

**Why it works:**

- ✅ Specific, not vague ("80%+" not "most")
- ✅ Outcome-focused (employment, income)
- ✅ Transformation shown (before → after)
- ✅ Third-party validation (employer count)

### C. Benefit-Driven Headlines

**Pattern: Problem → Solution**

❌ WEAK: "About Our Training Programs"
✅ STRONG: "Creating Opportunity for Careers in Tech"

❌ WEAK: "We Have Multiple Locations"
✅ STRONG: "A Growing National Resource for Tech Talent"

❌ WEAK: "Our Impact"
✅ STRONG: "Advancing Economic Mobility"

**Why it works:**

- ✅ Focuses on outcome, not process
- ✅ Aspirational language
- ✅ Reader-centric (what they get)
