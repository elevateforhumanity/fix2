### Email Body

Dear [Name],

I am writing to request consideration of Elevate for Humanity Technical & Career Institute as a SNAP E&T third-party training provider under Indiana's SNAP Employment & Training program.

**Elevate for Humanity is an ETPL-approved, WIOA-aligned workforce training provider offering hybrid education, work-based learning, and registered apprenticeship pathways. We are seeking to serve as a SNAP E&T third-party provider to absorb SNAP participants into credentialed, employment-linked programs that meet the 80-hour monthly participation requirement.**

### Our Current Approvals

- **ETPL-Approved**: All programs eligible for WIOA funding
- **DWD Location ID**: 10004621 (INTraining)
- **DOL Registered Apprenticeship Sponsor**: RAPIDS ID 2025-IN-132301
- **WRG Approved**: All programs eligible for Workforce Ready Grant
- **JRI Partner**: Serving justice-involved populations

### Why We're Positioned for SNAP E&T

We already provide the infrastructure SNAP E&T requires:

✅ **80-Hour Compliance Tracking** - Real-time attendance and hour verification  
✅ **Industry-Recognized Credentials** - State licenses, DOL certificates, industry certifications  
✅ **Work-Based Learning** - DOL-registered apprenticeships with paid employment  
✅ **Job Placement** - 85% placement rate with verified wage outcomes  
✅ **Wraparound Support** - Transportation, childcare, barrier removal services  
✅ **Proven Outcomes** - 500+ students trained, serving WIOA, WRG, and JRI populations

### Programs Mapped to SNAP E&T Categories

| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Education & Training**  | CNA, HVAC, Barber, Esthetics, Tax Prep, CHW, Home Health Aide, Peer Recovery Coach, CDL |

### What We're Requesting

1. **Recognition** as a SNAP E&T third-party training provider
2. **Referral pathway** for SNAP participants into our ETPL programs
3. **Hour tracking alignment** - our attendance system counts toward SNAP compliance
4. **Reimbursement structure** - training costs, support services, participant expenses

### What We're NOT Requesting

We understand our role as a training provider and do NOT seek to:

- ❌ Determine SNAP eligibility
- ❌ Administer SNAP benefits
- ❌ Act as prime SNAP E&T contractor
- ❌ Receive direct SNAP payments

We remain in our lane: training, work experience, hour tracking, and job placement.

### Immediate Capacity

- **100+ SNAP participants per quarter**
- **Multiple cohort start dates** (weekly, bi-weekly, monthly)
- **Flexible scheduling** (day, evening, weekend)
- **Statewide reach** (online/hybrid delivery)
- **Same-quarter implementation** ready

### Next Steps

I would welcome the opportunity to:

1. Present our capabilities in a brief meeting
2. Review our program mapping to SNAP E&T categories
3. Discuss reporting requirements and data exchange
4. Establish a referral and reimbursement process

I have attached:

- SNAP E&T Program Map (all programs with hour requirements)
- Capability Statement (credentials, outcomes, infrastructure)
- Sample compliance reports (attendance tracking, outcomes)

## Follow-Up Email (If No Response in 2 Weeks)

**Subject**: Following Up - SNAP E&T Partnership Request

Dear [Name],

I wanted to follow up on my email from [date] regarding Elevate for Humanity's interest in serving as a SNAP E&T third-party training provider.

Given the recent DOL-USDA alignment and Indiana's focus on connecting SNAP participants to credentialed pathways, I believe our ETPL-approved programs and 80-hour compliance infrastructure could be valuable to your SNAP E&T network.

Would you be available for a brief 15-minute call to discuss?

I'm happy to work around your schedule.

Best regards,

Elizabeth Greene

## Talking Points for Phone Calls

### Opening

"Hi, this is Elizabeth Greene from Elevate for Humanity. I sent an email about partnering as a SNAP E&T third-party provider. Do you have a moment to discuss?"

### Key Points (30 seconds)

"We're an ETPL-approved training provider with DOL-registered apprenticeships. We already track 80-hour compliance for WIOA and JRI participants, and we're positioned to immediately absorb SNAP E&T referrals into credentialed pathways with verified job placements."

### The Ask

"I'd love to schedule a brief meeting to show you our program map and discuss how we can support Indiana's SNAP E&T goals. Would 15-30 minutes work in the next week or two?"

### Objection Handling

**"We already have providers"**
→ "That's great. We're not looking to replace anyone—we're adding capacity. We can absorb 100+ participants per quarter with immediate starts."

**"We need to see your credentials"**
→ "Absolutely. We're ETPL-approved, DOL-registered (RAPIDS 2025-IN-132301), and DWD Location ID 10004621. I can send our full capability statement today."

**"What makes you different?"**
→ "We already operate like a federal contractor. We track hours in real-time, verify all outcomes, and have an 85% job placement rate. Most importantly, we're ready now—no new systems to build."

**"How do you handle the 80-hour requirement?"**
→ "All our programs are structured for 80+ hours per month. We track daily attendance, tag hours by SNAP activity type, and export monthly compliance reports. We've been doing this for WIOA and JRI for years."
