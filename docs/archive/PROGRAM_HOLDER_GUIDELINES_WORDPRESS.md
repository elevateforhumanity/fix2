## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many apprentices can I host?

Most shops start with one apprentice. You can host multiple apprentices if you have adequate supervision (1 licensed barber per apprentice recommended).

### What if the apprentice doesn't work out?

You can terminate the apprenticeship with proper notice. We'll work with you to address issues and potentially match you with a different apprentice.

### Do I have to pay for their classroom training?

No. Related Technical Instruction (RTI) is covered through WIOA funding or other sources. You only pay the apprentice's hourly wage for shop work.

### What if I've never trained an apprentice before?

We provide full support including mentor training, documentation templates, and ongoing guidance. You're not alone in this process.

### How long does the apprenticeship last?

Typically 12-18 months to complete 1,500 hours. Timeline varies based on full-time vs part-time schedule.

### Can the apprentice work for me after they get licensed?

Yes! Many apprentices continue working at their training shop after licensure. You have first opportunity to hire them.
