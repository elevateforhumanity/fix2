## 🚀 How It Works

### In Gitpod (Automatic)

When you open this repo in Gitpod, the script pack is **automatically generated**:

1. Gitpod reads `.gitpod.yml`
2. Runs `scripts/bootstrap-elevate-scripts.sh`
3. Creates `docs/Elevate_Script_Pack.md`
4. Ready to use immediately!

### Manual Generation

```bash
# Run the bootstrap script
bash scripts/bootstrap-elevate-scripts.sh

# View the generated pack
cat docs/Elevate_Script_Pack.md
```
