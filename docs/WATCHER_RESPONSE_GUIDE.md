# Watcher Response Guide

How to handle people watching your build and turn them into buyers or filter them out.

---

## The Situation

Someone is watching your platform, asking questions, but not committing. They want to understand "how it works" without defining their role or bringing value.

**This is observer behavior, not partner behavior.**

---

## Response Strategy

### Step 1: Send ONE Message (Copy-Paste)

```
I'm formalizing access and partnership discussions to protect the platform 
and participants. If you want to move forward, please submit through our 
Partner With Us page. If you're looking to operate using our system quickly, 
we also offer licensing with defined access and terms.
```

**Then stop explaining anything technical.**

---

### Step 2: Direct Them to Pages

**For Partnership:**
- URL: `/partner-with-us`
- Requires: IP acknowledgment + structured inquiry
- Outcome: You review and classify

**For Licensing:**
- URL: `/licensing`
- Offers: Defined tiers with pricing
- Outcome: They pay for access, not your IP

---

### Step 3: If They Push Back

**If they say:** "Why do we need NDA / why gate?"

**You respond:**
```
Because EFH is a sponsor/operator and the platform contains proprietary 
compliance workflows, partner delivery structure, and operational systems. 
This is standard. If you're serious, it won't slow anything down.
```

**Then stop engaging.**

## Decision Matrix

### Green Flags (Real Partner/Licensee):
- ✅ Completes gated form
- ✅ Acknowledges IP ownership
- ✅ Discusses what they bring
- ✅ Asks about next steps
- ✅ Willing to sign agreements
- ✅ Has budget/authority

### Red Flags (Observer):
- ❌ Avoids the form
- ❌ Resists IP acknowledgment
- ❌ Keeps asking "how" questions
- ❌ Won't commit to written agreement
- ❌ Says "just curious" or "exploring"
- ❌ Compares you to other platforms

---

## Classification Logic

### If they complete the form → Review
- Check: What they bring
- Check: Relationship type
- Check: Written agreement willingness
- Classify: Partner / Licensee / Decline

### If they avoid the form → Observer
- Stop technical engagement
- No backend access
- No system explanations
- No further meetings

---

## Licensing Tiers (Turn Watchers into Buyers)

### Tier 1: Operator License
- **Price**: $499/month + $1,500 setup
- **For**: Single location operators
- **Includes**: Platform access, student portal, compliance workflows

### Tier 2: Multi-Site License
- **Price**: $1,250/month + $3,500 setup
- **For**: Up to 5 locations
- **Includes**: Everything in Tier 1 + multi-location dashboards

### Tier 3: Enterprise License
- **Price**: Custom ($2,500+/month, $10,000+ setup)
- **For**: White-label operations
- **Includes**: Everything + branding, dedicated support, API access

**Key Rule**: They pay for access, not your brain.

---

## What NOT to Share (Ever)

### Never Share Without Written Agreement:
- ❌ Backend access
- ❌ System architecture
- ❌ AI prompt logic
- ❌ Enrollment mechanics
- ❌ Compliance workflows
- ❌ Partner integration details
- ❌ Database structure
- ❌ API documentation

**Until their role is defined in writing.**

## Response Scripts

### Script 1: Initial Boundary (Use Once)
```
I'm formalizing all partnership discussions through our structured review 
process to protect the platform and participants. If you're interested in 
exploring alignment, please submit a request through our Partner With Us 
page. I'll review and follow up if there's a fit.
```

### Script 2: If They Ask Technical Questions
```
I don't share technical details or system architecture outside of defined 
partnerships or licensing agreements. If you're interested in using the 
platform, licensing is available at /licensing.
```

### Script 3: If They Want to "Just Talk"
```
I've moved all exploratory conversations to a structured process. Please 
submit through /partner-with-us and I'll review. If you're looking for 
quick access, licensing is available.
```

### Script 4: If They Resist the Process
```
This is how we protect our systems and participants. If that doesn't work 
for you, I understand. Let me know if your situation changes.
```

**Then stop responding.**

## What Happens Next

### If They Complete the Form:
1. Review their submission
2. Classify: Partner / Licensee / Observer

## Important Reminders

### You Are:
- ✅ Platform owner
- ✅ System operator
- ✅ Partnership reviewer
- ✅ Institutional leader

### You Are NOT:
- ❌ Idea sharer
- ❌ Demo provider
- ❌ Open source project
- ❌ Applicant seeking validation

---

## Soft Protection Checklist

Make sure these are present on your site:

- ✅ Footer: Proprietary notice (global)
- ✅ Apply page: IP acknowledgment
- ✅ Student dashboard: "Authorized participants only"
- ✅ Partner page: Checkbox gate + inquiry capture
- ✅ Licensing page: Clear tiers and pricing
- ✅ NDA: Ready to send
- ✅ Terms of Use: Complete legal framework

---

## When to Escalate

### Contact Legal If Someone:
- Misrepresents affiliation with EFH
- Uses EFH materials without authorization
- Claims to have "partnered" with EFH
- Replicates EFH systems or workflows
- Violates signed NDA
- Scrapes or harvests data

---

## Success Metrics

### Good Outcomes:
- Observer disappears (saved your time)
- Real partner completes form (qualified lead)
- Licensee pays for access (revenue)
- Clear boundaries established (protection)

### Bad Outcomes:
- You keep explaining systems (IP leak)
- You give backend access without agreement (exposure)
- You justify your process (defensive posture)
- You continue "watching" conversations (wasted time)

---

## Final Rule

**No one gets backend access, system explanations, or operational details until their role is defined in writing.**

That's not distrust.  
That's leadership.
