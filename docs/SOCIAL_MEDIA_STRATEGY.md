# ELEVATE FOR HUMANITY - SOCIAL MEDIA STRATEGY

## Core Principle

Elevate for Humanity is a workforce hub, not an influencer brand.

Social media must:
- Build trust
- Explain opportunity
- Drive people to programs, advisors, and resources
- NOT oversell
- NOT mix free vs paid improperly
- NOT fragment the ecosystem
