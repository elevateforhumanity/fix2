# Partner Response Scripts

Professional scripts for setting boundaries without burning bridges.

---

## Option A: Very Neutral (Recommended)

```
I'm open to exploring alignment, but at this stage I'm moving conversations into a more structured format. Before sharing further details about systems or workflows, I ask all potential partners to acknowledge IP boundaries and confidentiality.

If you're still interested, I'm happy to share a brief overview of roles and partnership options.
```

**Use when:** You want to filter intent without being warm or cold.

---

## Option B: Slightly Warmer, Still Firm

```
I appreciate your interest in what I'm building. At this point, I'm protecting internal systems and shifting discussions toward defined roles and outcomes. Before going deeper, I use a simple IP and confidentiality acknowledgment with anyone exploring partnership.

Let me know if you'd like to move forward from there.
```

**Use when:** You want to maintain relationship but establish boundaries.

---

## Option C: Direct and Professional

```
Thanks for your interest. At this stage, I'm only having detailed conversations with parties who are prepared to:

1. Sign a mutual NDA and IP acknowledgment
2. Complete a partnership intake form
3. Define what resources or value they bring

If that works for you, I'm happy to send those over.
```

**Use when:** You want to be very clear about requirements upfront.

---

## Option D: Redirect to Process

```
I've moved all partnership discussions to a formal process. You can start by reviewing our partnership overview and submitting an intake form at:

This helps me understand what you're looking for and what you bring to the table.
```

**Use when:** You want to automate the filtering process.

## How to Interpret Their Response

### If they say:
- "Of course"
- "That makes sense"
- "Send it over"

**👉 They're serious.**

### If they say:
- "Why do we need that?"
- "I was just curious"
- "I don't do NDAs"
- "Can we just talk first?"

**👉 They were extracting, not partnering.**

You lose nothing by finding that out early.

## Follow-Up After Positive Response

```
Great. I'm attaching:

1. Mutual NDA & IP Acknowledgment
2. Partnership Intake Form

Once I receive these back, I'll schedule a call to discuss potential alignment and next steps.
```

---

## Follow-Up After Negative/Evasive Response

```
No problem. If your situation changes and you're ready for a more formal discussion, feel free to reach out.
```

**Then:** Stop engaging. They've shown their intent.

## Important Reminders

### You are:
- A sponsor
- A platform owner
- A system builder
- A licensed professional
- A funding gateway

### You are NOT:
- Asking permission
- Seeking validation
- Explaining yourself
- Defending boundaries

**That's leadership.**

## Red Flag Responses to Watch For

1. **"I just want to understand how it works"**
   - Translation: I want to copy it

2. **"Can you walk me through the backend?"**
   - Translation: I want to see your IP

3. **"I'm talking to a few platforms"**
   - Translation: I'm shopping for ideas

4. **"Let's just have a casual conversation first"**
   - Translation: I don't want boundaries

5. **"I don't usually sign NDAs this early"**
   - Translation: I extract from multiple sources
