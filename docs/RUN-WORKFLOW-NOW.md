# 🚀 RUN THIS NOW: Close Breaking Dependabot PRs

## ⚡ Quick Action Required

You need to manually trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to close the 5 breaking Dependabot PRs.

---

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Open GitHub Actions
Click this link: [**Run Workflow Now**](https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/actions/workflows/close-dependabot-prs.yml)

Or navigate manually:
1. Go to: https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2
2. Click the **"Actions"** tab at the top
3. In the left sidebar, click **"Close specific Dependabot PRs"**

### 2. Trigger the Workflow
1. You'll see a blue button that says **"Run workflow"** on the right side
2. Click it
3. A dropdown will appear:
   - Branch: `main` (should be selected by default)
4. Click the green **"Run workflow"** button

### 3. Monitor Progress
- The workflow will start immediately
- You'll see 5 jobs running in parallel (one for each PR)
- Each job takes ~10-30 seconds
- Total time: ~1 minute

### 4. Verify Success
After the workflow completes:
- All 5 jobs should show green checkmarks ✅
- Click on any job to see details

### 5. Check PRs Were Closed
Visit: [Open Dependabot PRs](https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/pulls?q=is:pr+author:app/dependabot+is:open)

You should see:
- ✅ The 5 breaking PRs are now closed
- ✅ Each has a comment explaining why
- ✅ Each has labels: `blocked`, `manual-upgrade`

---

## 🎯 What This Workflow Does

For each of these 5 PRs:

| PR | Reason for Closing |
|----|-------------------|
| `tailwindcss-4.1.14` | Major breaking changes (config, syntax, browser requirements) |
| `react-19.2.0` | Peer dependency conflicts with react-helmet-async |
| `@sentry/react-10.19.0` | Major version requires migration |
| `vite-7.1.10` | Potential breaking changes |
| `react-router-dom-7.9.4` | Major API changes |

The workflow will:
1. 🔍 Find the open PR
2. 💬 Add comment: "Major version with breaking changes - will upgrade manually when ready"
3. 🏷️ Add labels: `blocked`, `manual-upgrade`
4. ❌ Close the PR

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Why Manual Trigger?
- GitHub Actions in this environment doesn't have automatic authentication
- The workflow is configured for manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`)
- This is intentional for safety and control

### What If Some PRs Are Already Closed?
- The workflow will skip them gracefully
- You'll see: "No open PR found for [branch]. Skipping."
- This is normal and not an error

### What If Labels Don't Exist?
- The workflow will continue without adding labels
- You'll see: "Could not add labels (may not exist). Continuing."
- The PR will still be closed successfully

## 🔄 Alternative: CLI Method

If you prefer to run locally (requires GitHub CLI):

```bash
# Authenticate (first time only)
gh auth login

# Run the script
./scripts/close-dependabot-prs.sh
```

---

## ✅ Expected Results

After running the workflow, you should see:

### In GitHub Actions:
```
✅ Close dependabot/npm_and_yarn/tailwindcss-4.1.14
✅ Close dependabot/npm_and_yarn/react-19.2.0
✅ Close dependabot/npm_and_yarn/sentry/react-10.19.0
✅ Close dependabot/npm_and_yarn/vite-7.1.10
✅ Close dependabot/npm_and_yarn/react-router-dom-7.9.4
```

### In Pull Requests:
- 5 closed PRs with explanation comments
- No more failing builds from these PRs
- Future Dependabot PRs will only include safe updates

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Run workflow" button is grayed out
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Make sure you have write access to the repository
- Try refreshing the page

### Workflow fails with "Resource not accessible by integration"
- The workflow needs `pull-requests: write` permission
- This is already configured in the workflow file
- Try re-running the workflow

### Can't find the workflow
- Make sure the latest commits are pushed to `main`
- Wait 30 seconds for GitHub to index the new workflow
- Refresh the Actions page

---

## 📊 After Completion

Once the workflow succeeds:

1. ✅ **Builds will pass** - No more breaking Dependabot PRs
2. ✅ **Deployments work** - CI/CD pipeline is stable
3. ✅ **Future PRs safe** - Dependabot configured to avoid breaking changes
4. ✅ **Security updates** - Patch updates still automatic

---

## 🎉 You're Done!

After running this workflow:
- All breaking Dependabot PRs will be closed
- Your builds will be stable
- You can plan major upgrades on your own schedule

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor for new Dependabot PRs (should only be safe updates)
- Plan major version upgrades when ready
- Review `docs/dependabot-build-fix.md` for migration notes
