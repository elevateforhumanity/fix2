## 🤖 Puppeteer Worker Details

### What It Does

The Puppeteer worker is a headless browser automation that:

- **Logs in** to using your credentials
- **Navigates** through the Durable dashboard
- **Finds** the Custom Code section
- **Adds** the bridge script automatically
- **Saves** the changes
- **Verifies** the integration worked
- **Takes** screenshots for proof
- **Reports** success or failure

### When It Runs

- **Automatically:** Every 6 hours
- **On-demand:** Can be triggered manually
- **Coordinated:** By Master Orchestrator

### What It Needs

**GitHub Secrets (add these once):**

```
DURABLE_EMAIL=your-durable-email@example.com
DURABLE_PASSWORD=your-durable-password
```

**That's it!** Once you add these secrets, the worker handles everything.

## 🎯 Manual Trigger (Optional)

If you want to run the Puppeteer worker immediately:

### Via GitHub Actions UI

1. Go to: https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/actions
2. Click "Puppeteer Worker - Durable Integration"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Click "Run workflow" button

### Via Command Line

```bash
gh workflow run puppeteer-durable-worker.yml
```

## 📊 Monitoring

### GitHub Actions

**URL:** https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/actions

**Look for:**

- "Puppeteer Worker - Durable Integration"
- Check run status
- View logs
- Download screenshots

### Workflow Artifacts

Each run creates:

- Screenshot of Durable dashboard
- Integration status JSON
- Detailed logs

**Retention:** 30 days

### Status Reports

5. **Type** the bridge script into the editor
6. **Click** save button
7. **Verify** the code was added
8. **Take** screenshot for proof

All automatically, no human required!
