## Response Script (Use Once)

```
I'm formalizing access and partnership discussions to protect the platform 
and participants. If you want to move forward, please submit through our 
Partner With Us page. If you're looking to operate using our system quickly, 
we also offer licensing with defined access and terms.
```

## What NOT to Share

Never share without written agreement:
- Backend access
- System architecture
- AI prompts
- Enrollment mechanics
- Compliance workflows

## You Are Now

✅ Platform owner (not idea sharer)  
✅ System operator (not demo provider)  
✅ Partnership reviewer (not applicant)  
✅ Institutional leader (not experimenter)

**This is how serious platforms protect themselves.**
