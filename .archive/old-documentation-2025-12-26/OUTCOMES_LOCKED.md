## How to Write Outcomes (Step-by-Step)

### Step 1: Research Real Data

- Check Indeed/Glassdoor for actual salaries in Indiana
- Look up exact credential names on state websites
- Count actual training hours from curriculum
- Find real job postings to see titles

### Step 2: Write Specific Statements

**Template**:

```
Job: [Exact title] at [type of workplace]
Credential: [Official name] from [issuing body]
Earnings: [Range] starting, [Range] after [timeframe]
Completion: [Hours/weeks] doing [specific activities]
```

### Step 3: Remove All Vague Words

- Potential
- Competitive
- Industry-standard
- Comprehensive
- Professional
- Quality

**Replace with**:

- Numbers

---

## The Test

Show outcomes to a student. Ask: "What will you be able to do?"

**Correct answer**:

- "I'll be a licensed barber making $45,000"
- "I'll be an HVAC tech earning $25/hour"
- "I'll be a CNA working at a hospital"

**Wrong answer**:

- "I'll have opportunities"
- "I'll have a pathway"
- "I'll be supported"

If they can't give a specific answer, the outcomes fail.
