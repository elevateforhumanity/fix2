# FOR YOU PAGES - 10/10 ENTERPRISE BLUEPRINT

## Current State Analysis

### Students Page (6/10)

**Problems:**

- Hero has TWO CTAs (Apply + Call) - creates decision paralysis
- "What We Offer" explains YOUR system, not THEIR problem
- Anxiety reduction comes too late (buried in step 3)
- Multiple CTAs throughout (Apply, Browse Programs, Learn Funding, Call)
- No eligibility checker - students don't know if they qualify
- No journey checklist - students don't know what happens next

**Anxiety Points Not Addressed Early:**

1. "Will this cost me?" (answered in step 3, should be in hero)
2. "Am I eligible?" (never directly answered)
3. "Will I mess this up?" (no reassurance)
4. "Is someone helping me?" (mentioned but not emphasized)

### Employers Page (6.5/10)

**Problems:**

- Reads like partnership proposal, not value proposition
- Too much explanation of workforce systems
- Not enough ROI language (time saved, risk reduced)
- Phase 4 section is interesting but too long
- Multiple CTAs (Call, Partner Packet, Call again)
- No clear forced path

**What Employers Actually Want:**

1. Time saved (not mentioned early)
2. Risk reduced (buried)
3. Compliance handled (mentioned but not emphasized)
4. Talent quality (implied but not stated)

### Agencies Page (7/10)

**Problems:**

- Too much overlap with student/employer language
- Not enough explicit alignment language
- Reads like narrative, not briefing
- No metrics, no reporting outcomes emphasized
- Multiple CTAs (Licensing, Demo, Call, Email)

**What Agencies Need:**

1. Clear alignment (mentioned but not emphasized)
2. Reduced liability (not mentioned)
3. Measurable outcomes (implied but not stated)
4. Predictability (not mentioned)
