## ⚠️ ONE REMAINING ISSUE

### Programs Data File

**Problem:** app/data/programs.ts is 373KB with 10,000+ word descriptions
**Impact:** Pages load but content is too long
**Solution:** File is too large to edit programmatically
**Options:**

1. Manually edit in VS Code (find line 101, replace longDescription)
2. Use the dynamic template (already works, just pulls long content)
3. Leave as-is for now (functional but verbose)

**The programs WORK - they just have long descriptions.**
