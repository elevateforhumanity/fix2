# Master Prompt Library - Compliance, Policies, Grants, Execution

## Purpose

This library contains battle-tested prompts for policy creation, compliance auditing, grant writing, and execution. Use these to turn AI into a compliance analyst, regulator, grant reviewer, and execution partner.

---

## A. DECISION & SCOPE CONTROL

**Use First - Before Writing Anything**

### Prompt A1: Regulatory Clarity

```
Act as a regulator reviewing my organization. Based on my business type, jurisdiction, and services, what exact approvals am I pursuing right now, and what policies are non-negotiable for approval?
```

**When to Use:** Starting new compliance work, unclear on requirements  
**Output:** List of required approvals and non-negotiable policies

### Prompt A2: Stop Doing List

```
List what I should stop working on right now because it does not directly affect approval, inspection, or funding.
```

**When to Use:** Feeling overwhelmed, too many priorities  
**Output:** Items to pause or eliminate

## B. POLICY CREATION

**Use When Drafting or Revising Policies**

### Prompt B1: Enforceable Policy Draft

```
Draft this policy so it is enforceable, auditable, and defensible. Clearly define responsibility, monitoring, documentation, and consequences for non-compliance.
```

**When to Use:** Creating new policy or strengthening existing  
**Output:** Policy with 4 critical elements (responsibility, monitoring, documentation, consequences)

### Prompt B2: Plain Language Translation

```
Rewrite this policy in plain language for staff while preserving regulatory compliance.
```

**When to Use:** Policy is too technical or legalistic  
**Output:** Staff-friendly version that maintains compliance

---

## C. POLICY AUDIT

**Use After Policy Exists**

### Prompt C1: Hostile Auditor Review

```
Review this policy as a hostile auditor. Identify vague language, missing enforcement, unclear ownership, or anything that would trigger follow-up questions.

## E. JURISDICTION & PROGRAM CONTROL

**Use When States or Programs Overlap**

## USAGE RULES

### Before Using Any Prompt, Ask:

**Am I asking AI to help me decide, defend, or document?**

- **Decide:** Use A, G, H prompts
- **Defend:** Use C, D prompts
- **Document:** Use B, F prompts

### Workflow:

1. **Start:** Use A prompts (scope control)
2. **Create:** Use B prompts (policy creation)
3. **Audit:** Use C prompts (policy audit)
4. **Apply:** Use D prompts (grant alignment)
5. **Execute:** Use F prompts (simplification)
6. **Maintain:** Use G prompts (strategy)
7. **Unstick:** Use H prompts (decision lock)

## ANTI-PATTERNS (Don't Do This)

### ❌ Vague Prompts:

- "Help me with my policy"
- "Review this"
- "What do you think?"

### ✅ Specific Prompts:

- "Review this as a hostile auditor"
- "Convert this to grant language"
- "Identify compliance gaps"

### ❌ Open-Ended:

- "Tell me everything about WIOA"
- "What should I do?"

### ✅ Focused:

- "What WIOA policies are non-negotiable for approval?"
- "What should I work on first?"

### ❌ Premature:

- Asking for implementation before scope is clear
- Asking for details before structure is solid

### ✅ Sequenced:

- Scope → Structure → Details → Execution

---

## MAINTENANCE

### Weekly:

- Run G1 (Sequencing)
- Run G2 (Over-engineering check)

### Before Submission:

- Run C1 (Hostile auditor)

---

## INTEGRATION WITH FEATURE REGISTER

### Link Policies to Features:

For each feature in Master Feature Register, use these prompts to complete Gate 5 (Compliance Alignment):

1. **Identify Required Policy:**

   ```
   What policy must govern [FEATURE NAME] for regulatory compliance?
   ```

2. **Link Policy to Feature:**

   ```
   How should [POLICY NAME] be referenced in the UI for [FEATURE NAME]?
   ```

3. **Verify Alignment:**
   ```
   Review [FEATURE NAME] and [POLICY NAME] for alignment. Identify any mismatches in language, requirements, or enforcement.
   ```

---

## NEXT ACTIONS

### Immediate:

1. Pick one active policy
2. Run Prompt C1 (Hostile Auditor Review)
3. Fix identified gaps
4. Run Prompt C2 (Inspector Questions)
5. Prepare answers

### This Week:

1. Run Prompt G1 (Sequencing) - Monday
2. Run Prompt G2 (Over-engineering) - Friday
3. Use Prompt H1 if stuck

### Before Next Submission:

1. Run all C and D prompts
2. Create one-page checklists (F2)

## SUCCESS METRICS

### You're Using This Right If:

## SUPPORT

### If Prompts Don't Work:

1. Check if you're using right category (decide/defend/document)
2. Make prompt more specific
3. Provide more context
4. Break into smaller questions

### If Still Stuck:

Use Prompt H1 (Decision Blocker) to identify what needs to be locked before proceeding.
