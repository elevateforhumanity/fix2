## PHASE 2: CONTEXT & MESSAGE ALIGNMENT

### Common Issues Found

**1. Insider Language**

- Terms used without explanation: "WIOA," "WRG," "JRI," "ETPL," "RAPIDS"
- **Fix:** First use should include brief explanation or link to glossary

**2. Missing "What Happens Next"**

- Many CTAs don't explain the next step
- Example: "Apply Now" without context of what the application involves
- **Fix:** Add context: "Apply Now - Takes 5 Minutes" or "Start Your Free Application"

**3. Assumed Knowledge**

- Pages assume visitors know what program holders are
- Pages assume visitors understand funding sources
- **Fix:** Add brief context at top of each page

**4. Inconsistent Terminology**

- "Program Holder" vs "Training Provider" vs "Partner"
- "Student" vs "Learner" vs "Participant"
- **Fix:** Standardize on one term per role

---

## PHASE 3: HUMANIZE & POLISH RECOMMENDATIONS

### Homepage - Already Strong ✅

**Current (Good):**

```
Free Job Training.
Real Careers. No Debt.

We connect people to careers through training, funding, and
employer partnerships across Indiana.
```

**Why it works:**

- Direct, no fluff
- Clear value proposition
- Human and confident
- No buzzwords

**Keep as-is.**

---

### Programs Page - Strong with Minor Tweaks

**Current (Good):**

```
Your Future Starts Here

Here's the truth: You don't need a college degree to build a great career.
You need the right training, the right support, and someone who believes in you.
```

**Why it works:**

- "Here's the truth" is human and grounded
- Addresses real concerns
- Supportive but not patronizing

**Minor improvement:**
Add clearer funding explanation at top:

```
All programs are 100% free through Indiana Career Connect and WIOA funding.
No tuition. No student loans. No hidden costs.
```

---

### Apply Page - Needs Clarity

**Current Issues:**

**Recommended Copy:**

```
Start Your Free Application

- Your education and work history
- Which program interests you

After you submit:
1. We'll review your application (1-2 business days)

## PHASE 4: CTA & INSTRUCTION CLARITY

### Current CTA Issues

**Vague CTAs:**

- ❌ "Learn More" (learn more about what?)
- ❌ "Get Started" (start what?)
- ❌ "Apply Now" (no context)

**Clear CTAs:**

- ✅ "Apply for Free Training"
- ✅ "See All Programs"
- ✅ "Talk to an Advisor - (317) 314-3757"
- ✅ "Upload Required Documents"

### CTA Improvement Rules

1. **Be Specific:** Say what happens
2. **Add Context:** Include time or outcome
3. **Remove Friction:** Explain what's needed
4. **Provide Alternatives:** Phone, email, chat

**Examples:**

**Before:**

```
<Button>Apply Now</Button>
```

**After:**

```
<Button>Start Free Application (5 min)</Button>
<p className="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-2">
  No cost. No commitment. We'll help you every step.
</p>
```

## PHASE 5: CONSISTENCY & TRUST CHECK

### Terminology Standardization

**Roles (Use Consistently):**

- ✅ Student (not "learner" or "participant")
- ✅ Program Holder (not "training provider" or "partner" unless context-specific)
- ✅ Employer (not "business" or "company")
- ✅ Workforce Board (not "board" alone)

**Funding Sources (Always Explain First Use):**

- ✅ "WIOA (Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act)"
- ✅ "Indiana Career Connect (state workforce funding)"
- ✅ "WRG (Workforce Ready Grant)"
- ✅ "JRI (Justice Reinvestment Initiative)"

**Program Types:**

- ✅ "Training Program" (not "course" or "class")
- ✅ "Credential" (not "certificate" unless specific)
- ✅ "On-the-Job Training (OJT)" (always spell out first)

### Trust-Building Language

**Use:**

- "100% free" (clear)
- "No student debt" (specific)
- "Funded by Indiana Career Connect" (credible source)
- "Industry-recognized credentials" (specific outcome)

**Avoid:**

- "Empowering" (vague)
- "Revolutionary" (hype)
- "Cutting-edge" (marketing)
- "World-class" (unverifiable)
