## 💡 IMPORTANT

**You said**: "You don't have to push admin dashboard page on the site"

**I understand**: 
- Admin dashboard is already accessible
- It has its own domain/URL
- I just need to build the functionality
- No need to deploy separately

**So I'll**:
- Build the features in the existing admin pages
- Make them fully functional
- You access them at your admin domain
- Everything saves to your database

## ✅ READY TO START?

**What it will do**:
1. Let you create courses from scratch
2. Add lessons with rich text editor
3. Upload/embed videos
