# Wording & Page Structure Audit

## 📝 HOMEPAGE ANALYSIS

### Current Structure:
1. Hero Image
2. Featured Programs (3 cards)
3. Hero Text ("Transform Your Future")
4. Why Choose Us
5. Success Stories
6. Facilities
7. Final CTA

### Wording Assessment:

#### ✅ What's Working:
- **"Transform Your Future"** - Strong, aspirational
- **"Free career training. Real opportunities. Life-changing results."** - Clear value prop
- **"Earn while you learn"** - Compelling benefit
- **"Built for people navigating real barriers"** - Empathetic, authentic

#### ⚠️ Could Be Stronger:
- **"Featured Programs"** → Consider: "Start Your Career in 3 Steps" or "Choose Your Path"
- **"DOL Registered Apprenticeships"** → Too jargon-heavy for first impression
- **"Why Choose Elevate"** → Generic, consider: "Why Students Choose Us" or "What Makes Us Different"

#### ❌ Missing:
- **Opening hook** - No immediate attention grabber
- **Social proof** - No stats visible immediately (1000+ graduates, 95% placement)
- **Urgency** - No mention of enrollment deadlines or limited spots
- **Specific outcomes** - No salary ranges or job titles mentioned upfront

## 📄 PROGRAM PAGE ANALYSIS (Barber Example)

### Current Structure:
1. Hero Image
2. Hero Text (title + description + CTA)
3. "Here's How It Works" (overview)
4. Stats (2,000 hours, $0, Day 1)
5. "What You'll Master" (skills)
6. "Yes, It's Really Free" (funding)
7. "What Happens After" (outcomes)
8. Final CTA

### Wording Assessment:

#### ✅ What's Working:
- **"Here's How It Works"** - Conversational, approachable
- **"You'll train in real barbershops"** - Specific, tangible
- **"Yes, It's Really Free"** - Addresses skepticism directly
- **"We know 'free training' sounds too good to be true"** - Empathetic, honest
- **Conversational tone** - "You'll earn money from day one—wages plus tips"

#### ⚠️ Could Be Stronger:
- **"Become a Barber"** → Consider: "Launch Your Barber Career" or "Start Earning as a Barber"
- **"Get paid to learn your craft"** → Good, but could add urgency: "Start earning $15-18/hour while you train"
- **"What You'll Master"** → Consider: "Skills That Pay" or "What You'll Learn to Earn"
- **"Your First Year: $35,000 - $55,000"** → Good, but bury the lead. Put this higher!

#### ❌ Missing:
- **Timeline** - How long does it actually take? (mentioned 2,000 hours but not weeks/months)
- **Prerequisites** - What do I need to start? (age, education, etc.)
- **Next steps** - What happens after I click Apply?
- **Student stories** - Real examples of graduates
- **Day in the life** - What does training actually look like?
