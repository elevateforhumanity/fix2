## 🔥 3-STEP ACTIVATION PROCESS

### STEP 1: DATABASE (30 minutes) - YOU DO THIS

**File Created**: `ALL_MIGRATIONS_COMBINED.sql` (15,972 lines)

**Instructions**:
1. Open your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Open the file `ALL_MIGRATIONS_COMBINED.sql`
4. Copy ALL contents
5. Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
6. Click "Run"
7. Wait for completion (may take 5-10 minutes)
8. Verify no errors

**What This Does**:

   ```

2. **Vercel Auto-Deploy**
