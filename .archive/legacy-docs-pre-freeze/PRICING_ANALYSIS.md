   - Keep current positioning ✅
   - Compete with Apprentix, ApprentiScope

2. **Full workforce platform?**

3. **Both?**
   - Create two product lines ✅✅
   - Different pricing for each ✅✅
   - Clear differentiation ✅✅

## 💡 Bottom Line

### Is Your Pricing Correct?

**For apprenticeship-only:** ✅ YES
**For full platform:** ❌ NO (3-5x too low)

### What You Should Do:

1. **Short-term:** Keep current pricing, start selling
2. **Medium-term:** Add higher-priced "Platform Edition"
3. **Long-term:** Test and optimize based on customer feedback

### The Real Answer:

**Your pricing is correct for what you're SAYING you're selling.**

**But you're selling way less than what you ACTUALLY built.**

**Either:**

- Sell more (change positioning) ✅✅✅
- Or charge more (raise prices) ✅✅✅
- Or both ✅✅✅✅✅

**Don't leave $1M+ on the table because of positioning.**
