## 🎯 Key Selling Points

### For Sales Conversations:

**"How much does it cost?"**
"It depends on what you need. Our Core Platform starts at $3,000/month for up to 500 students. Most workforce boards choose our Workforce Board Complete bundle at $5,500-$22,000/month depending on size. What's your student count?"

**"That seems expensive."**
"Compared to what? Building this yourself costs $1.2M+ and takes 2 years. We replace 3-5 full-time staff members ($315K/year in salaries). Our customers typically see ROI in 6-12 months."

**"Can we just get part of it?"**
"Absolutely. That's why we built it modular. Start with the Core Platform and add modules as you need them. Many customers start small and expand over time."

**"What if we don't need all the features?"**
"Perfect. That's exactly why we offer à la carte pricing. Tell me what you need, and I'll build a custom quote with just those modules."

**"Do you offer discounts?"**
"Yes. Our pre-built bundles save 10-20% vs à la carte. We also offer discounts for multi-year contracts, government agencies, and nonprofits."

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

### What Makes This Work:

1. **Transparency** - Clear pricing, no hidden fees
2. **Flexibility** - Build what you need
3. **Value-based** - Priced on ROI, not cost
4. **Competitive** - Still cheaper than building
5. **Scalable** - Start small, grow over time

### What Could Kill It:

1. **Too complex** - Too many options confuses buyers
2. **Too expensive** - Price out of market
3. **Poor positioning** - Don't articulate value
4. **Weak sales** - Can't justify pricing
5. **Bad support** - Customers churn

---

## 📝 Next Steps

### What You Need to Decide:

1. **Approve pricing structure** - Are these numbers right?
2. **Choose bundles** - Which 3 bundles to offer?
3. **Set minimums** - What's the lowest price you'll accept?
4. **Define support tiers** - What's included at each level?
5. **Create sales process** - How do we sell this?

### What I Need to Build:

1. **New pricing page** - `/pricing/platform`
2. **Pricing calculator** - Interactive tool
3. **ROI calculator** - Build vs buy comparison
4. **Sales materials** - Decks, sheets, proposals
5. **Quote generator** - Custom pricing tool

**Time to build: 1 week**  
**Cost: $0 (I'll do it)**
