# Elevate for Humanity - Sales Pitch (Dec 17th)

## 🎯 3-MINUTE SALES PITCH SCRIPT

### Opening Hook (30 seconds)
"Workforce boards and training providers face an impossible challenge: you need to track learners across multiple programs, report outcomes to DOL and state agencies, manage WIOA and ETPL compliance, write grants, and coordinate with dozens of training partners—all while using disconnected spreadsheets, outdated LMS systems, and manual processes.

What if you had one platform that actually understood your world?"

### The Problem (30 seconds)
"Right now, you're probably:
- Manually tracking enrollments across CNA schools, CDL programs, barber academies, and HVAC partners
- Spending weeks on grant applications and quarterly reports
- Struggling to show real-time outcomes to funders
- Losing learners because they can't navigate your fragmented systems
- Paying $50-100 per learner per month for generic LMS platforms that don't understand workforce development

And your training providers? They're drowning in paperwork instead of teaching."

### The Solution (60 seconds)
"Elevate is the only multi-app workforce ecosystem built specifically for WIOA, ETPL, and apprenticeship programs.

**Four connected apps:**
1. **Learner App** - Students discover programs, apply, track progress, earn stackable credentials
2. **Provider App** - CNA schools, barber academies, CDL partners manage cohorts and report outcomes
3. **Board Dashboard** - You see real-time enrollments, completions, and grant-ready reports
4. **Admin Console** - Your team manages everything from one place

**Plus two game-changers:**
- **Grant Autopilot** - AI-assisted grant writing that understands DOL, EDA, and workforce funding
- **VITA Module** - Free tax prep for your learners (builds trust, increases retention)

Everything is WIOA-aligned, ETPL-ready, and designed for grant-funded ecosystems."

### Pricing Transparency (30 seconds)
"Here's what makes this different: transparent, grant-friendly pricing.

**Full platform license: $50,000 one-time**
- That's about $200 per learner at 250 learners
- Compare that to $50-100/month per learner with traditional LMS platforms
- Most partners fund this through WIOA admin funds, innovation grants, or DWD technology budgets

**Or start smaller:**
- Individual apps from $8,000-$20,000
- White-label for multi-region deployments: $100,000
- Full codebase acquisition for state-level buyers: $500,000

No per-seat fees. No surprise costs. One license, unlimited learners."

### Differentiation (30 seconds)
"Why Elevate instead of Canvas, Absorb, or building your own?

1. **We speak your language** - Built for WIOA, ETPL, WRG, JRI, not corporate training
2. **Multi-stakeholder by design** - Learners, providers, boards, and funders all have their own apps
3. **Grant-funded friendly** - Pricing designed for workforce budgets, not enterprise SaaS
4. **Rapid deployment** - 2-4 weeks from license to launch, not 6-12 months
5. **White-label ready** - Your brand, your domain, your ecosystem

And here's the kicker: we can generate a fully licensed, branded version of the platform for you in under an hour."

### Closing CTA (30 seconds)
"Here's what I'd like to do:

**Option 1: Live Demo** - 30 minutes, I'll show you the learner journey, provider workflows, and board dashboard with real data

**Option 2: Pilot Program** - 90-day pilot with one program (CNA, CDL, or Barber), 50 learners, full support - $15,000

**Option 3: Licensed Deployment** - We generate your branded platform, deploy it, train your team - live in 30 days

Which makes the most sense for [Organization Name]?"
