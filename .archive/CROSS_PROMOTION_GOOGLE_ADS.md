## Important Notes

1. **Never Mix Budgets**: Keep grant-funded and paid campaigns completely separate

2. **Curvature Exclusion**: Body sculpting services are NOT advertised in Google Ads - only mentioned as optional wellness resource on websites

3. **Mission Alignment**: All three nonprofit programs (Elevate, Selfish Inc, RISE Forward) must clearly support the mission of removing barriers to success

4. **Transparency**: Always identify SELFISH INC as parent organization and clarify which services are nonprofit vs. for-profit partners

5. **Compliance First**: When in doubt, err on the side of caution - focus ads on primary mission (workforce training for grant, specific services for paid)
