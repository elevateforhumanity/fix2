# Netlify Deployment Status & Instructions

## Current Status

**Latest Commit:** `347a371b` - fix: disable Netlify cache plugin causing deployment failures  
**Push Status:** ✅ Successfully pushed to origin/main  
**Deployment:** ⏳ Triggered automatically on Netlify

---

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Cache Plugin Failure ✅

**Error:** "Some specified paths were not resolved, unable to cache dependencies"

**Root Cause:**

- `netlify-plugin-cache` trying to cache `.pnpm-store` path
- Path doesn't exist in Netlify build environment
- Causing build to fail

**Solution:**

- Disabled `netlify-plugin-cache` in `netlify.toml`
- Netlify's built-in caching is sufficient
- Reduces plugin complexity

### Issue 2: Lighthouse Plugin Error ✅

**Error:** "Plugin '@netlify/plugin-lighthouse' internal error"

**Root Cause:**

- Puppeteer module compatibility issue
- Named export 'PuppeteerNode' not found

**Solution:**

- Already disabled in previous commit
- Not critical for deployment

---

## How to Monitor Deployment

### Method 1: Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to Deploys Page:**

   ```
   https://app.netlify.com/sites/elevateforhumanityfix2/deploys
   ```

2. **Look for Latest Deploy:**
   - Should show commit: "fix: disable Netlify cache plugin"
   - Status will be: Building → Published

3. **Click on Deploy to See Logs:**
   - Real-time build progress
   - Any errors will show here
   - Estimated time: 2-3 minutes

4. **Wait for "Published" Status:**
   - Green checkmark = Success
   - Red X = Failed (check logs)

### Method 2: Check Live Site

Once deployed, verify:

```
https://www.elevateforhumanity.org
```

Should load without errors.

---

## If Deployment Still Fails

### Check Build Logs

1. Go to failed deploy in Netlify dashboard
2. Scroll through logs to find error
3. Common issues:

#### Error: "Build exceeded maximum allowed runtime"

**Solution:** Build is taking too long (>15 min on free tier)

- Check for infinite loops in build scripts
- Disable heavy plugins
- Optimize build process

#### Error: "Command failed with exit code 1"

**Solution:** Build script error

- Check `package.json` scripts
- Verify all dependencies installed
- Test build locally: `pnpm build`

#### Error: "Module not found"

**Solution:** Missing dependency

- Check `package.json` has all dependencies
- Verify imports are correct
- Run `pnpm install` locally

### Manual Retry

If deploy fails:

1. **Via Dashboard:**
   - Click failed deploy
   - Click "Options" → "Retry deploy"

2. **Via Git:**

   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: trigger Netlify rebuild"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Via Netlify CLI:**
   ```bash
   netlify deploy --prod
   ```
