## BUDGET ALLOCATION

Total: $10,000/month = $333.33/day

**Strategy**: Maximize all $10,000/month by running multiple campaigns simultaneously

### Campaign Budget Distribution

- **Campaign 1 (Healthcare)**: $100/day = $3,000/month (30%)
- **Campaign 2 (Skilled Trades)**: $100/day = $3,000/month (30%)
- **Campaign 3 (Retail/RISE Up)**: $67/day = $2,000/month (20%)
- **Campaign 4 (General Workforce)**: $66/day = $2,000/month (20%)

**Total**: $333/day = $10,000/month (100% of grant utilized)

### Why This Split?

1. **Healthcare (30%)** - Highest demand, fastest placement
   - CNA, Medical Assistant, Patient Care
   - Strong employer demand
   - Quick training completion

2. **Skilled Trades (30%)** - High-paying careers
   - HVAC, Building Maintenance, CDL
   - Excellent job prospects
   - Good wages for graduates

3. **Retail/RISE Up (20%)** - Growing program
   - NRF Foundation partnership
   - Entry-level opportunities
   - Flexible scheduling

4. **General Workforce (20%)** - Catch-all
   - Career changers
   - WIOA eligibility searches
   - Broad workforce keywords

### Budget Optimization Tips

**Month 1-2**: Start with even split to gather data
**Month 3+**: Adjust based on performance
- Increase budget for campaigns with 7%+ CTR
- Decrease budget for campaigns below 5% CTR
- Pause low-performing ad groups
- Shift budget to high-converters

### Daily Budget Management

**Morning (9 AM - 12 PM)**: 40% of daily budget
- Peak search times for job seekers
- Highest intent traffic

**Afternoon (12 PM - 5 PM)**: 35% of daily budget
- Steady search volume
- Good conversion rates

**Evening (5 PM - 9 PM)**: 25% of daily budget
- After-work searches
- Research mode traffic

### Maximizing the Full $10,000

**To ensure you use the full grant:**
1. Run all 4 campaigns simultaneously
2. Don't pause campaigns unless CTR drops below 3%
3. Add more keywords if budget isn't being spent
4. Expand to nearby cities if needed (Carmel, Fishers, Greenwood)
5. Test different ad variations
6. Use all ad extensions
7. Bid higher on top-performing keywords

**Warning Signs You're Not Using Full Budget:**
- Campaigns ending day with unspent budget
- Impressions dropping significantly
- Limited by budget (should be limited by bids)
- CTR above 10% (too restrictive, expand reach)

**How to Spend More (If Needed):**
- Add more keyword variations
- Expand geographic targeting (25-mile radius → 50-mile radius)
- Add related programs (Phlebotomy, EKG Tech, etc.)
- Create seasonal campaigns (back-to-school, new year)
- Test broader match types (phrase → broad match modifier)

## CROSS-PROMOTION STRATEGY (Google Ads Compliant)

### Important: Google Ad Grants Policy on Cross-Promotion

**What's Allowed:**
- Promoting related nonprofit services that support your mission
- Linking to partner organizations that enhance program outcomes
- Mentioning holistic support services (mental health, wellness)

**What's NOT Allowed:**
- Promoting commercial businesses unrelated to mission
- Advertising for-profit services as primary focus
- Using grant funds primarily for commercial promotion

### Our Compliant Approach

**Primary Focus**: Workforce training (WIOA-funded career programs)

**Supporting Services** (mentioned on landing pages, NOT in ads):
1. **Selfish Inc** - Mental wellness support (501c3 nonprofit)
   - Trauma recovery, divorce support, addiction programs
   - Supports career readiness through mental health
   - Mentioned as "holistic support" on site

2. **Curvature Body Sculpting** - Physical wellness
   - Mentioned briefly as wellness partner
   - NOT promoted in ad copy
   - Listed as optional self-care resource

### Landing Page Strategy

**Main Landing Pages** (for ads):
- `/apply` - Application form (primary conversion)
- `/programs` - Career training programs
- `/funding` - WIOA/WRG information
- `/programs/rise-up` - NRF retail training

**Supporting Pages** (organic traffic only):
- `/selfish-inc` - Mental wellness programs
- Homepage mentions holistic support
- Cross-promotion in footer/sidebar only

### Ad Copy Rules

**✅ DO:**
- Focus 100% on career training in ad copy
- Mention WIOA, workforce development, job placement
- Link to career training pages
- Use keywords related to job training

**❌ DON'T:**
- Mention Curvature or body sculpting in ads
- Use "wellness" as primary keyword
- Link ads to commercial services
- Promote mental health as primary service

### Traffic Distribution

**Google Ads Traffic** → Career Training Pages
- 100% focused on workforce development
- WIOA/WRG funded programs
- Job placement and career services

**Organic/Social Traffic** → All Services
- Homepage shows holistic ecosystem
- Selfish Inc page for mental wellness
- Cross-links between related services

### Compliance Checklist

- [ ] All ad copy focuses on career training
- [ ] Landing pages primarily about workforce development
- [ ] Mental wellness mentioned as support service only
- [ ] No commercial services in ad copy
- [ ] Cross-promotion limited to on-site content
- [ ] Primary mission (workforce training) is clear
