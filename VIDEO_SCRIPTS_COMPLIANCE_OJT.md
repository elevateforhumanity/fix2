# 🎥 Video Scripts - Compliance, OJT Pay & JRI Stipends

## VIDEO 1: Program Holder Compliance Training (25 minutes)

### Script: "Complete Guide to Program Compliance & Documentation"

```
[INTRO - 0:00-1:00]

Welcome to the Program Holder Compliance Training. I'm going to walk you through everything you need to know about compliance requirements, documentation, and getting paid for your training services.

This is critical information. Following these guidelines ensures you get paid on time, students get the support they need, and we all stay compliant with WIOA, WRG, and other funding requirements.

Let's get started.

[SECTION 1: PAYMENT STRUCTURE - 1:00-5:00]

First, let's talk about how you get paid. Your revenue share is 1/3 of the grant funding per student, but it's paid in three installments based on student progress.

Here's the breakdown:

25% AT STUDENT START
You receive 25% of your share when the student enrolls and attends their first day of class.

For example, if a student is funded at $5,000, your total share is $1,667. 
At start, you receive 25% of that, which is $417.

35% AT MIDPOINT
When the student reaches 50% program completion, you receive 35% of your share.
That's $583 in our example.

40% AT COMPLETION
When the student successfully completes the program with all required documentation, you receive the final 40%.
That's $667 in our example.

Total: $417 + $583 + $667 = $1,667 per student.

This performance-based payment structure ensures students are progressing and completing programs, which is what funders require.

[SECTION 2: REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION - 5:00-12:00]

Now, let's talk about the documentation required for each payment. This is non-negotiable. Without proper documentation, payments will be delayed or denied.

[SECTION 3: COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS - 12:00-18:00]

Beyond documentation, there are ongoing compliance requirements you must follow:

ATTENDANCE TRACKING
- Take attendance every class session
- Document absences and reasons
- Contact students after 2 consecutive absences
- Report excessive absences to Elevate immediately

Students must maintain 80% attendance to remain eligible for funding. If a student drops below 80%, they may be terminated from the program and you will not receive remaining payments for that student.

PROGRESS MONITORING
- Assess student progress weekly
- Provide feedback and support
- Document interventions for struggling students
- Report concerns to Elevate early

PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT
- Maintain appropriate instructor-student boundaries
- Follow code of conduct

- Protect student privacy (FERPA compliance)

FACILITY & SAFETY

RECORD KEEPING
- Maintain student files for 7 years
- Keep all documentation organized
- Respond to audit requests within 48 hours
- Protect confidential information

[SECTION 4: COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID - 18:00-22:00]

Let me share the most common mistakes that delay payments:

MISTAKE #1: INCOMPLETE DOCUMENTATION
Missing signatures, blank fields, or partial forms will delay your payment. Double-check everything before submitting.

MISTAKE #2: LATE SUBMISSIONS
Submit documents on time. Late submissions mean late payments. Set reminders for yourself.

MISTAKE #3: POOR ATTENDANCE TRACKING
Inconsistent or inaccurate attendance records are a red flag in audits. Take attendance every single class.

MISTAKE #4: NOT REPORTING ISSUES EARLY
If a student is struggling, absent, or having problems, tell us immediately. Don't wait until it's too late.

MISTAKE #5: MISSING DEADLINES
Know your program deadlines and stick to them. Late completions may not be reimbursed.

ATTENDANCE: 80% OR HIGHER
This is the most important requirement. You must attend at least 80% of all scheduled classes.

For example, if your program has 100 class hours, you can miss no more than 20 hours.

If you need to miss class:

- Get back on track immediately

GRADES: PASSING IN ALL SUBJECTS

[SECTION 3: OJT PAY - ON-THE-JOB TRAINING - 8:00-13:00]

Now let's talk about OJT - On-the-Job Training. This is a program where you can get PAID while you complete training with an employer.

[SECTION 4: JRI STIPENDS - JUSTICE REINVESTMENT INITIATIVE - 13:00-18:00]

JRI is a special program for individuals with criminal justice involvement. If you qualify, you can receive a STIPEND while you complete training.

The Justice Reinvestment Initiative provides stipends to help justice-involved individuals complete training and secure employment. This is grant funding specifically for re-entry participants.

HOW MUCH IS THE STIPEND?

JRI stipends are typically:

- Paid bi-weekly
- For the duration of your training program
- Up to 6 months maximum

The exact amount depends on:
- Your program length

[SECTION 5: COMBINING BENEFITS - 18:00-19:00]

CAN YOU RECEIVE BOTH OJT PAY AND JRI STIPENDS?

No. You cannot receive both at the same time. Here's why:

- OJT is employment. You're earning wages.
- JRI stipends are for training when you're NOT employed.

You must choose one or the other.

WHICH SHOULD YOU CHOOSE?

OJT is usually better because:
- Higher pay (real wages vs. stipend)
- Work experience
- Potential for permanent job
- Builds your resume

But JRI may be better if:
- You need flexibility for other obligations
- You're not ready for full employment
- You need more training first
- OJT positions aren't available

Talk to your case manager about what's best for your situation.

[CLOSING - 19:00-20:00]

You have everything you need to succeed:
- Clear requirements for completion
- Support services to help you
- Opportunities for OJT pay or JRI stipends
- A team that believes in you

Your job is to:
- Show up every day
- Do your best work
