## Your Netlify Site

**Site ID:** `12f120ab-3f63-419b-bc49-430f043415c1`

## How to Verify Pro Tier

### Method 1: Netlify Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to your Netlify dashboard:**

   ```
   https://app.netlify.com/sites/elevateforhumanityfix2/settings/general
   ```

2. **Check "Plan" section:**
   - Look for "Current plan" near the top
   - Should say: **"Pro"** or **"Pro Team"**
   - If it says "Starter" or "Free" → You need to upgrade

3. **Check build minutes:**

   ```
   https://app.netlify.com/sites/elevateforhumanityfix2/settings/billing
   ```

   - Pro tier includes: **25,000 build minutes/month**
   - Starter tier includes: **300 build minutes/month**
   - If you see 25,000 → You're on Pro ✅

### Method 2: Check Billing Page

1. **Go to team billing:**

   ```
   https://app.netlify.com/teams/YOUR_TEAM_NAME/billing
   ```

2. **Look for:**
   - Monthly charge: **$19/month** (Pro tier)
   - Build minutes: **25,000/month**
   - Concurrent builds: **3** (vs 1 on Starter)

### Method 3: Check Build Settings

1. **Go to build settings:**

   ```
   https://app.netlify.com/sites/elevateforhumanityfix2/settings/deploys
   ```

2. **Check "Build concurrency":**
   - Pro tier: **3 concurrent builds**
   - Starter tier: **1 concurrent build**

## If You're NOT on Pro

### Upgrade to Pro

3. **Select "Pro" tier:**
   - $19/month
   - 25,000 build minutes
   - 3 concurrent builds

### Why You Need Pro

Based on your usage:

- **401 minutes used** in current period
- **317 commits in 2 weeks** = high build frequency
- **Starter tier (300 min)** is insufficient
- **Pro tier (25,000 min)** gives you plenty of headroom
