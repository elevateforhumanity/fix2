## Setup Instructions

### 1. Run Database Migration

Open Supabase SQL Editor and run:
```bash
supabase/migrations/001_lms_schema.sql
```

This will:
- Create all 7 tables
- Set up Row Level Security policies
- Seed sample data (6 programs, 1 course, 1 lesson, 1 quiz)

### 2. Verify Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in `.env` and Netlify:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

### 3. Add Program Images

Add images to `/public/programs/`:
- `cna.jpg`
- `welding.jpg`
- `nails.jpg`
- `cdl.jpg`
- `office.jpg`
- `osha.jpg`
- `placeholder.jpg` (fallback)

### 4. Test Locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Visit:
- http://localhost:5173/programs
- http://localhost:5173/lms

### 5. Deploy

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat: add complete LMS implementation"
git push origin main
```

Netlify will auto-deploy.
