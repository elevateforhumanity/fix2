# State-by-State Expansion Rules (Tax Ops)

These rules govern when a Sub-Office may operate in a new state and what must be verified before processing returns.

## 1. Non-Negotiable Preconditions (Any State)

1. Signed Sub-Office MOU on file (PDF)
2. Documented onboarding completion
3. Identity verification and background screening policy applied
4. Secure document handling process confirmed
5. Compensation split locked: 45% of base fee only (no add-ons)
6. Season bonus rules acknowledged as discretionary

## 2. Operating Model (Uniform)

- Main Office controls pricing, forms/add-ons, software (Drake), and filing authority
- Sub-Office performs intake + preliminary prep only
- Main Office handles compliance, final review, filing, notices, audits

## 3. State Readiness Checklist (Before Launch)

A) Business registration status confirmed (entity standing where required)
B) Local business licensing confirmed (city/county if applicable)
C) Any state-specific tax preparer registration requirements checked and satisfied
D) Data privacy / retention requirements reviewed
E) Client communication templates updated for the state (address, contact, disclosures)

## 4. Fraud / Risk Controls (Always On)

- No filing without ID verification
- No filing without signed engagement acknowledgement (your intake rules)
- No cash handling by sub-offices unless explicitly approved in writing
- No refund-based pricing or refund advance promises
- Rejected returns are not compensated

## 5. What Triggers "Complex Pricing" (Any State)

- Any Schedule C / self-employment
- Multiple W-2s (3+)
- Multiple income streams (W-2 + 1099-R + investments)
- Amended returns
- Prior-year issues / notices

## 6. When You Pause a State Expansion

- Error rate exceeds 3%
- Any compliance flag appears
- Pattern of missing documentation
- Sub-office refuses standardized process

## 7. Documentation That Must Exist (Audit-Proof)

- Signed MOU PDF
- Onboarding completion record
- Return logs (accepted/rejected)
- Bonus report output (season-report.json)
- Written exception approvals (if any)

This gives you a repeatable compliance spine that scales across Indiana and beyond.
