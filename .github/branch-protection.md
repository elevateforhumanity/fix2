# Branch Protection Rules

## Main Branch Protection

To prevent extra branches and keep everything on main:

1. Go to GitHub repository settings
2. Click "Branches" in left sidebar
3. Click "Add rule" for branch protection
4. Branch name pattern: `main`
5. Enable these rules:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date
   - ✅ Include administrators
   - ✅ Restrict who can push to matching branches

This ensures:
- All changes go through main branch
- No random branches created
- Everything stays integrated
- Single source of truth

## Current Status
- All code on main branch ✅
- No duplicate branches ✅
- Everything integrated ✅
