# How to Find Your Netlify Site URL

## Method 1: Check Netlify Dashboard

1. Go to: **https://app.netlify.com
2. Log in to your account
3. Click on your site (should be named something like "fix2" or "elevate-lms")
4. Look at the top of the page - you'll see your site URL

It will look like one of these:

- `https://random-name-123.netlify.app
- `https://fix2.netlify.app
- `https://elevate-lms.netlify.app

## Method 2: Check Latest Deploy

1. In Netlify dashboard, click "Deploys" tab
2. Look at the latest deploy
3. If it says "Published", click on it
4. You'll see the site URL

## Method 3: Check Your Email

Netlify sends an email when your site deploys successfully.
Check your email for "Deploy succeeded" from Netlify.

## Once You Have the URL

**Tell me the URL** and I'll create all clickable links for you!

Example: "My URL is https://elevate-lms.netlify.app"

Then I'll give you links like:

- https://elevate-lms.netlify.app/lms/dashboard
- https://elevate-lms.netlify.app/admin/program-holders
- https://elevate-lms.netlify.app/program-holder/dashboard
- etc.

## Can't Find It?

If you can't find your Netlify URL, you can also:

1. Check your GitHub repository settings
2. Look for "Environments" or "Deployments"
3. The URL should be listed there
