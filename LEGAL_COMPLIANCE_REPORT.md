## Detailed Analysis

### 1. Partner/Brand Name Usage

**Found References:**
- Milady (barber theory)
- HSI (safety training)
- Choice Medical Institute (CNA)
- National Drug (workplace training)
- CareerSafe (OSHA training)
- Certiport (IT certifications)

**Legal Status**: ✅ **SAFE**

**Why It's Safe:**
- You're describing educational partnerships, not claiming to BE these companies

- Similar to how colleges say "We use Microsoft Office" or "Cisco Certified"

**Recommendation:**
Add this disclaimer to your footer or terms page:

```
"Elevate for Humanity partners with industry-leading credential providers 
including Milady, HSI, CareerSafe, Certiport, and others. All trademarks 
are property of their respective owners. Elevate for Humanity is an 
independent training provider and is not owned by or affiliated with 
these organizations beyond our educational partnerships."

## What Would Cause a Takedown?

**These would be problems (you DON'T have these):**
- ❌ Copying another school's exact website design
- ❌ Using their logo without permission
- ❌ Claiming to BE another organization
- ❌ Stealing their copyrighted course materials
- ❌ Using their trademarked slogans
- ❌ Copying their student testimonials

**What you're doing (this is LEGAL):**
- ✅ Describing educational partnerships
- ✅ Mentioning industry-standard tools
- ✅ Using common education website patterns
- ✅ Creating original content
- ✅ Building custom technology

## Bottom Line

**Your site is legally sound.** You're not mimicking anyone in a way that would cause problems. The only actions needed are:

1. Add partner disclaimer (5 minutes)
2. Verify image licenses (1 hour)
3. Get partner agreements (ongoing)

**Risk of Takedown**: Less than 1%

The bigger risk is NOT protecting YOUR OWN content from being copied (which we just fixed with the security measures).
