**Your Plan:** Use credentialed partners, go after corporations, and have program holders

**Translation:** This is BRILLIANT. Here's why and how to execute.

---

## üí° Your Hybrid Model Explained

### **Three Revenue Streams:**

#### **1. Credentialed Partners (B2B2C)**

Partner with organizations that already have certifications/credentials and use your platform to deliver them.

**Examples:**

- CompTIA (IT certifications)
- Epic Systems (EHR training)
- AHIMA (Healthcare certifications)
- ServSafe (Food safety)
- OSHA (Safety training)

**How it works:**

- They provide the curriculum/certification
- You provide the platform + delivery
- You split revenue 70/30 or 60/40

#### **2. Corporations (B2B)**

Sell directly to companies for employee training.

**Examples:**

- Amazon (warehouse training)
- Walmart (retail training)
- Healthcare systems (clinical training)
- Manufacturing companies (safety training)

**How it works:**

- They pay per employee or annual license
- You provide platform + content
- They get trained workforce

#### **3. Program Holders (Government B2G)**

Work with government-funded programs that pay for student training.

**Examples:**

- WIOA (Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act)
- SNAP E&T (Food stamp employment training)
- TANF (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families)
- Vocational Rehabilitation
- DOL Apprenticeships

**How it works:**

- Government pays $3K-$10K per student
- You provide training + certification
- Students get trained for free
