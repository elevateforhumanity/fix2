## 🎓 STUDENT ORIENTATION VIDEOS

### VIDEO 1: Welcome to Elevate for Humanity (10 minutes)

```
[OPEN WITH ENERGY]

Hey there! Welcome to Elevate for Humanity. I'm so excited you're here!

[PAUSE]

You know what? You just made one of the best decisions of your life. Seriously. You're about to start a journey that's going to completely change your future. And the best part? It's 100% free. No tuition. No debt. No catch.

[PAUSE]

So let me tell you what Elevate is all about.

[SECTION 1: OUR MISSION - 1:00-3:00]

We're not just another training program. We're a movement. Our mission is simple: Innovate, Elevate, and Reset lives.

What does that mean for you?

INNOVATE means we're constantly finding new ways to help you succeed. We don't do things the old way just because "that's how it's always been done." We innovate to meet YOUR needs.

ELEVATE means we're lifting you up. Whether you're starting fresh, switching careers, or getting back on your feet - we're here to elevate you to the next level.

RESET means we believe in second chances. Third chances. As many chances as it takes. Your past doesn't define your future. This is your reset button.

[PAUSE]

And here's the thing - we're based right here in Indianapolis at Keystone Crossing. We're your neighbors. We're part of your community. And we're invested in YOUR success.

[SECTION 2: HOW IT WORKS - 3:00-6:00]

Alright, so how does this actually work? It's pretty straightforward.

STEP ONE: Pick Your Program
We've got over 20 career pathways. Healthcare, skilled trades, beauty, business, technology - you name it. Not sure what you want to do? That's okay! We'll help you figure it out.

STEP TWO: Get Funded
Here's where it gets good. Most of our students pay ZERO dollars. How? Through WIOA funding, Workforce Ready Grants, or paid apprenticeships. We handle all the paperwork. You just show up ready to learn.

STEP THREE: Train and Get Certified
You'll get hands-on training from industry experts. Real skills. Real credentials. The kind that employers actually care about.

STEP FOUR: Get Hired
We don't just train you and wish you luck. We connect you with over 200 hiring partners who are actively looking for people just like you. 89% of our graduates get hired within 90 days. That's not luck - that's results.

[PAUSE]

And get this - our average graduate earns between $35,000 and $55,000 a year. That's life-changing money for a lot of families.

[SECTION 3: WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT - 6:00-8:00]

So what makes Elevate different from other programs?

First, we're FREE. I can't say that enough. No tuition. No hidden fees. No debt hanging over your head.

Second, we're FAST. Most programs are 6 to 16 weeks. Not years. Weeks. You could be working in your new career in just a few months.

Third, we're SUPPORTIVE. You get a case manager. Career counseling. Help with transportation, childcare, whatever you need. We're not just teaching you skills - we're removing barriers.

Fourth, we're CONNECTED. We work with WorkOne, workforce boards, employers, and community partners. When you join Elevate, you're joining a whole network of people who want you to succeed.

[PAUSE]

And here's something really cool - we have special programs like our Barber Apprenticeship where we ship a FREE manikin to your house so you can practice at home. How awesome is that?

[SECTION 4: WHAT'S NEXT - 8:00-10:00]

Okay, so what happens next?

You're going to complete this orientation. It's got seven modules total. Take your time. Watch the videos. Read the materials. Take the competency test at the end - you need 70% to pass, but don't stress. You can retake it as many times as you need.

Once you finish orientation, you'll schedule your start date. You can do that right in the portal - pick a time that works for you, in-person or virtual.

Then you'll meet your case manager. They're going to be your go-to person for everything. Questions? Problems? Need help? They've got you.

And then? You start training. You start building your future. You start your new life.

[CLOSING - 9:00-10:00]

Look, I know starting something new can be scary. Maybe you're thinking "Can I really do this?" or "What if I fail?"

Let me tell you something: Over 3,200 people have gone through our programs. They had the same doubts. The same fears. And you know what? They made it. They're working. They're earning. They're thriving.

And you will too.

We believe in you. That's why we're here. That's why we do this.

So welcome to Elevate for Humanity. Welcome to your new beginning. Welcome to your future.

Let's do this!

### VIDEO 3: OJT & JRI - Getting Paid While You Train (15 minutes)

```
[OPEN WITH EXCITEMENT]

Okay, this is the video everyone wants to watch. How do you get PAID while you're training?

[PAUSE]

I'm going to break down two amazing programs: OJT and JRI. One of these might be perfect for you. Let's dive in!

[SECTION 1: WHAT IS OJT? - 0:00-5:00]

OJT stands for On-the-Job Training. And it's exactly what it sounds like - you get a real job, with a real paycheck, while you're learning.

Here's how it works:

An employer hires you. You work for them 20 to 40 hours a week. They train you on the job. And here's the kicker - they get reimbursed for 50% of your wages while they're training you.

So it's a win-win. You get paid. They get a trained employee. Everyone's happy.

[PAUSE]

How much do you make? Real wages. Not minimum wage. We're talking:
- HVAC trainees: $15 to $18 an hour
- Medical assistant trainees: $14 to $16 an hour
- Welding trainees: $16 to $20 an hour

Do the math. If you're working 40 hours a week at $16 an hour, that's $640 a week. Over $2,500 a month. While you're learning!

[PAUSE]

Now, who qualifies for OJT?

You need to:
1. Be enrolled in a training program (check!)
2. Have good attendance (80% or higher)
3. Be WIOA eligible (we'll help you figure that out)
4. Pass the employer's interview and screening
5. Commit to the training period (usually 3 to 6 months)

[PAUSE]

Here's the thing about OJT - it's competitive. Not everyone gets selected. Employers are looking for people who:
- Show up on time
- Have a good attitude
- Are eager to learn
- Take feedback well
- Are reliable

So if you want OJT, be that person. Show up. Work hard. Be professional. Make yourself the obvious choice.

[SECTION 2: WHAT IS JRI? - 5:00-10:00]

JRI stands for Justice Reinvestment Initiative. This is a special program for people with criminal justice involvement.

If you've been in the system - probation, parole, recently released - this program is designed specifically for you.

[PAUSE]

Here's what JRI offers:

A STIPEND while you complete training. We're talking $200 to $400 per week. Paid bi-weekly. For the duration of your program, up to 6 months.

That's not a job. That's a stipend to help you focus on training without worrying about how you're going to eat or pay rent.

[PAUSE]

Who qualifies for JRI?

You need to meet ALL of these:

1. CRIMINAL JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT
   Currently on probation or parole, OR released from incarceration within the past 5 years, OR diverted from the criminal justice system.

2. INDIANA RESIDENT
   You live in Indiana. Marion County residents get priority.

3. ENROLLED IN APPROVED TRAINING
   Healthcare, trades, or other high-demand fields. At least 20 hours a week.

4. LOW INCOME
   Under 200% of the poverty level. Unemployed or underemployed.

5. CASE MANAGEMENT
   You'll meet with your case manager weekly. This is required.

6. PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS
   80% attendance. Passing grades. Professional conduct. Drug-free.

[PAUSE]

Now let's be real about JRI. This is a second chance program. But it comes with rules.

You CANNOT work full-time and receive JRI stipends. The stipend is for training, not to supplement a job.

You MUST report any income immediately. Honesty is non-negotiable.

Missing appointments or classes? Your stipend gets suspended.

Positive drug test? You're out of the program.

New criminal activity? Immediate termination.

[PAUSE]

I'm not saying this to scare you. I'm saying it because I want you to succeed. JRI is an incredible opportunity. But you have to take it seriously.

[SECTION 3: OJT VS JRI - WHICH ONE? - 10:00-13:00]

So which one should you choose?

First, understand this: You CANNOT do both at the same time. It's one or the other.

[PAUSE]

Choose OJT if:
- You're ready to work NOW
- You need maximum income
- You want work experience on your resume
- You want a potential permanent job
- You can commit to an employer's schedule

Choose JRI if:
- You have criminal justice involvement
- You need more flexibility
- You want to focus on training first
- You need extra support
- You're not quite ready for full-time work

[PAUSE]

Still not sure? Talk to your case manager. That's literally what they're there for. They'll help you figure out what's best for YOUR situation.

[SECTION 4: HOW TO APPLY - 13:00-14:30]

Ready to apply?

FOR OJT:
1. Talk to your case manager
2. Complete the OJT application
3. Interview with employers
4. Get matched with a position
5. Start working and earning!

FOR JRI:
1. Disclose your background (be honest!)
2. Complete the JRI application
3. Provide required documentation
4. Meet with your case manager
5. Get approved and start receiving stipends

[PAUSE]

Both applications are in your student portal under "Financial Support."

[CLOSING - 14:30-15:00]

Look, whether you do OJT, JRI, or neither - you're still getting free training. You're still getting a credential. You're still getting a new career.

But if you qualify for OJT or JRI? Take advantage of it! Get paid while you learn. Make your life easier. Set yourself up for success.

You've got options. You've got support. You've got this.
