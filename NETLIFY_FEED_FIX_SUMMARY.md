# Netlify Feed Fix Summary

## Problem Diagnosed

**Issue:** API feeds returning 404 on Netlify  
**URL:** https://elevateforhumanityfix2.netlify.app/api/efh-config.json  
**Status:** 404 Not Found

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. Redirect Conflict in `netlify.toml`

All `/api/*` routes were being redirected to Netlify Functions, intercepting static JSON files.

```toml
# OLD - This was catching ALL /api/* requests
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/automated-reporting"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/automated-reporting"
  status = 200
```

### 2. Outdated Files in `public/api/`

The `bridge/api/` directory had updated files, but `public/api/` was stale.

```bash
# bridge/api/ had 7 programs (including CPRS)
# public/api/ had 6 programs (missing CPRS)
```

### 3. No Build Process for Bridge Files

Bridge files weren't being automatically synced to `public/` during build.

## Solutions Implemented

### âœ… Fix 1: Add Static File Exceptions to `netlify.toml`

Added explicit rules for static JSON files BEFORE function redirects:

```toml
# Static API files - serve directly (must come BEFORE function redirects)
[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/efh-config.json"
  to = "/api/efh-config.json"
  status = 200
  force = false

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/programs.json"
  to = "/api/programs.json"
  status = 200
  force = false

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/partnerships.json"
  to = "/api/partnerships.json"
  status = 200
  force = false

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/stats.json"
  to = "/api/stats.json"
  status = 200
  force = false

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/health.json"
  to = "/api/health.json"
  status = 200
  force = false
```

**Why this works:**

- Netlify processes redirects in order
- `force = false` means "only redirect if file doesn't exist"
- Static files in `dist/api/` are served directly
- Function redirects only catch dynamic endpoints

### âœ… Fix 2: Sync Bridge Files to Public

```bash
cp bridge/api/*.json public/api/
```

**Files synced:**

- `efh-config.json` - Updated with CPRS program (7 programs total)
- `programs.json` - NEW: Detailed program data with revenue projections
- `partnerships.json` - NEW: Partnership data worth $9M-$55M
- `stats.json` - NEW: Platform statistics and metrics

### âœ… Fix 3: Add CPRS Program to Bridge Config

Updated `bridge/api/efh-config.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "Certified Peer Recovery Specialist (CPRS)",
  "url": "/programs/cprs",
  "summary": "Launch a rewarding career in mental health recovery. WIOA/WRG funded program combining clinical training with peer support skills. $5,000 per student funding available."
}
```

Updated stats:

```json
{
  "programsOffered": "13+",
  "newPrograms": ["CPRS - Certified Peer Recovery Specialist"],
  "fundingAvailable": "WIOA, WRG, Apprenticeship Grants"
}
```

### âœ… Fix 4: Create Comprehensive API Feeds

#### `programs.json`

- 8 programs with detailed metadata
- Revenue projections for CPRS: $600K-$2.7M over 3 years
- Funding sources, duration, enrollment status

#### `partnerships.json`

- 10 active partnerships
- Government partners: EmployIndy, SOL, DOE
- Credentialing partners: Certiport, VITA, Milady, etc.
- Total value: $9M-$55M annually

#### `stats.json`

- Platform overview: 5000+ graduates, 92% placement rate
- CPRS projections: Year 1 $600K, Year 2 $1.2M, Year 3 $2.7M
- Business metrics: $2.5M-$8M valuation
- Enrollment capacity: 620-1040 students/year

## Build Process Verified

```bash
pnpm build

dist/ (generated by build)
â””â”€â”€ api/
    â””â”€â”€ (all files from public/api/)
```

### Build Flow

```
1. pnpm build
2. Vite copies public/ â†’ dist/
3. dist/api/*.json available for serving
4. Netlify deploys dist/
5. Static files served at /api/*.json
6. Functions only catch unmatched /api/* routes
```

### Redirect Order (Critical)

```toml
# 1. Static JSON files (force=false, serve if exists)
/api/efh-config.json â†’ /api/efh-config.json

# 2. Function endpoints (only if file doesn't exist)
/api/automated-reporting â†’ /.netlify/functions/automated-reporting

# 3. Catch-all (SPA routing)
/* â†’ /index.html
```
