# WRAP-AROUND LICENSING MODEL

## Platform Enhances Existing Operations, Doesn't Replace Them

**Date:** December 26, 2024  
**Critical Clarification:** The platform is designed to **wrap around** existing businesses, not replace them.

---

## THE CORE CONCEPT

### What "Wrap-Around" Means

The platform is **additive**, not **disruptive**:

✅ **You keep your existing business**  
✅ **You keep your existing students**  
✅ **You keep your existing programs**  
✅ **You keep your existing staff**  
✅ **You keep your existing processes**

The platform **adds**:

- Technology infrastructure (if you don't have it)
- Compliance automation (if you need it)
- Credentials (if you don't have them)
- Reporting tools (to save time)
- Student management (to reduce admin burden)

## HOW IT WORKS FOR EACH LICENSE TYPE

### 1. Program Holder Network (WITH Credentials)

**Your Existing Business:**

- You're a small nonprofit offering job training
- You teach welding, CDL, healthcare, etc.
- You have instructors, facilities, curriculum
- You recruit students from your community
- You place graduates in jobs

**What You DON'T Have:**

- ETPL credentials (can't access WIOA funding)
- Compliance infrastructure (manual reporting is painful)
- Technology platform (using spreadsheets)

**How Platform Wraps Around:**

```
YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS
├── Your instructors (keep them)
├── Your facilities (keep them)
├── Your curriculum (keep it)
├── Your students (keep them)
├── Your community relationships (keep them)
└── PLATFORM ADDS:
    ├── ETPL credentials (via MOU)
    ├── Compliance automation (saves time)
    ├── Student management system (replaces spreadsheets)
    ├── Automated reporting (to Indiana DWD)
    └── Technical support (when you need it)
```

**You Still Do:**

- Recruit students
- Teach classes
- Manage facilities
- Place graduates
- Build community relationships

**Platform Does:**

- Provide credentials
- Monitor compliance
- Generate reports
- Track student data
- Alert you to deadlines

**Result:** Your business **grows** because you can now access WIOA funding and serve more students.

---

### 2. Independent Platform (WITHOUT Credentials)

**Your Existing Business:**

- You're an existing ETPL provider
- You have your own credentials
- You have established programs
- You have staff and facilities
- You're already serving students

**What You DON'T Have:**

- Modern technology (using outdated LMS or spreadsheets)
- Mobile app (students want mobile access)
- Automated reporting (manual data entry is time-consuming)

**How Platform Wraps Around:**

```
YOUR EXISTING BUSINESS
├── Your credentials (keep them)
├── Your programs (keep them)
├── Your staff (keep them)
├── Your students (keep them)
├── Your compliance process (keep it)
└── PLATFORM ADDS:
    ├── Modern LMS (replaces outdated system)
    ├── Mobile app (students access on phone)
    ├── Reporting tools (saves admin time)
    ├── Student portal (self-service)
    └── White-label branding (your brand, not ours)
```

**You Still Do:**

- Recruit students
- Teach classes
- Manage compliance
- Report to Indiana DWD
- Place graduates

**Platform Does:**

- Provide technology infrastructure
- Host student data
- Generate reports (you submit them)
- Provide mobile access
- Handle technical support

**Result:** Your business **operates more efficiently** with better technology and less admin burden.
