### ⚠️ Branch Protection Issue

**Current Blocker:** Repository has branch protection rules requiring PRs for ALL branches.

**Impact:** Cannot push directly to `main` or any branch, preventing automatic deployment.

**Solution Options:**

#### Option 1: Disable Branch Protection (Recommended for Auto-Deploy)

You need to disable the repository ruleset that requires PRs:

1. Go to: https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/settings/rules
2. Find the ruleset affecting `main` and other branches
3. Either:
   - **Disable** the ruleset temporarily
   - **Edit** the ruleset to exclude GitHub Actions bot
   - **Add bypass** for GitHub Actions workflows

#### Option 2: Keep Protection, Use PR Workflow

If you want to keep branch protection:

1. Create PR from `fix/complete-production-ready` to `main`
2. Merge PR (this will trigger auto-deploy)
3. Future changes will auto-deploy on merge to `main`

#### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Best Practice)

1. Keep PR requirement for human developers
2. Allow GitHub Actions bot to bypass protection
3. Auto-deploy workflows can push directly
4. Manual changes still require PR review

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

### To Enable Auto-Deploy:

1. **Fix Branch Protection:**

   ```bash
   # Go to GitHub Settings
   https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/settings/rules

   # Option A: Disable the ruleset
   # Option B: Add bypass for github-actions[bot]
   # Option C: Edit ruleset to allow force pushes from workflows
   ```

2. **Merge Current Changes:**

   ```bash
   # Once protection is fixed, merge will auto-deploy
   git checkout main
   git merge fix/complete-production-ready
   git push origin main
   # → Triggers continuous-deploy.yml
   # → Deploys to Netlify automatically
   ```

3. **Verify Auto-Deploy:**
   - Push any change to `main`
   - Watch GitHub Actions tab
   - Check Netlify deployment
   - Verify site is live

### Future Deployments:

```bash
# Any push to main auto-deploys
git checkout main
git pull
# make changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: new feature"
git push origin main
# → Auto-deploys in 2-3 minutes
```

### Branch Previews:

```bash
# Any push to feature branch auto-deploys preview
git checkout -b feature/new-thing
# make changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: new thing"
git push origin feature/new-thing
# → Auto-deploys preview to Netlify
# → Comments preview URL on commit
```
