## FAQ

### "Is it really FREE?"
**Yes!** No setup fees, no monthly fees, no per-card fees. They make money from transaction fees and keep 40-60%. You keep the rest.

### "What if I only get 50 cards?"
**That's okay!** Most partners start small. You'll earn $288/month with 50 cards. As you grow, you earn more.

### "How do I get more cards?"
**Just ask!** They ship you more cards for free as you need them. Order 50, 100, 500 at a time.

### "What if a customer has a problem?"
**They handle it!** They provide 24/7 customer support. You don't deal with support issues.

### "How do I get paid?"
**Monthly direct deposit.** They calculate your revenue share and pay you automatically each month.

### "Can I cancel anytime?"
**Usually yes**, but check the contract. Most have 1-3 year terms but you can exit with 30-60 days notice.

### "What if I want my own cards later?"
**You can switch!** Start with white-label to test the market. Once proven, switch to your own program for higher margins.
