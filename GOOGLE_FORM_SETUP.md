   - Additional questions as needed

### 2. Get the Form URL

1. Click the "Send" button in your Google Form
2. Copy the link (it will look like: `https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc.../viewform`)

2. Add the following line:
   ```
   VITE_APPLICATION_FORM_URL=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/YOUR_FORM_ID/viewform
   ```

## Default Behavior

If no Google Form URL is configured, the "Apply Now" buttons will default to:

```
https://www.indianacareerconnect.com
```

## Where the Apply Button Appears

The "Apply Now" button appears in:

- Homepage hero section
- Programs page (on each program card)
- Individual program detail pages

## Testing

After configuration:

1. Build the site locally: `npm run build`
2. Preview: `npm run preview`
3. Click any "Apply Now" button
4. Verify it opens your Google Form in a new tab

## Troubleshooting

### Button still links to Indiana Career Connect

- Verify the environment variable is set correctly
- Rebuild the site after adding the variable
- Check browser console for any errors

### Form doesn't open

- Ensure the Google Form is set to "Anyone with the link can respond"
- Check that the URL is complete and correct
- Test the URL directly in a browser

## Example Google Form URL

```
https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc_example123/viewform
```

## Security Note

The Google Form URL is safe to expose publicly as it's meant to be accessed by applicants. However, ensure your form has appropriate spam protection enabled in Google Forms settings.
