---

## 2. What to Compare Visually (Design & Layout)

### 2.1 Hero section (top of homepage)
For each vendor, capture:

- **Headline style** (short, benefit-driven, not technical)
- **Sub-headline** (who it helps: employees, partners, customers, schools)
- **Primary CTA buttons** (e.g., "Get a demo", "Start free", "Talk to sales")
- **Hero visuals** (screenshots, people, dashboards, icons)

> ✏️ **Action for Elevate:**  
> Rewrite Elevate's hero to:
> - State clearly: "Workforce training & apprenticeships for [city/region]."
> - Call out: DOL-registered apprenticeships, ETPL/WRG/WorkOne alignment.
> - Include 1–2 CTAs: "Apply as a Student" and "Partner With Elevate".

---

### 2.2 Navigation menu & page structure

Document how each LMS structures the top menu:

- Common sections (e.g., Solutions, Products, Customers, Resources, Pricing)
- Where they put **"Compliance" / "Industries" / "Use Cases"**
- How they highlight **demo / trial / contact** links

> ✏️ **Action for Elevate:**
> - Create or refine top-nav groups such as:
>   - **Programs** (HVAC, Barber, CNA, Apprenticeships, etc.)
>   - **For Agencies** (WorkOne, EmployIndy, DWD partners)
>   - **For Employers** (OJT, WEX, Apprenticeship Sponsors)
>   - **About / Impact** (ETPL approvals, WRG, JRI, Success Stories)
>   - **Portals** (Student Login, Partner Portal, Employer Portal)

---

### 2.3 Section layout & visual rhythm

For each vendor, note:

- How they break the page into **horizontal bands** (hero, benefits, features, use-cases, logos, testimonials)
- Use of **icons, screenshots, cards** to visually group content
- Consistency in spacing, fonts, and color usage

> ✏️ **Action for Elevate:**
> - Rebuild long walls of text into:
>   - 3-column benefit sections
>   - Feature cards with icons
>   - "How it works" steps (1-2-3)
>   - Logos of partners (WorkOne, EmployIndy, training partners) for credibility

---

## 3. Functional Positioning (What They Say Their LMS *Does*)

### 3.1 Key feature themes to copy/adapt

- **Compliance training & tracking**
- **Onboarding & upskilling**
- **Multi-audience training** (employees, partners, customers, members)

---

## 4. Compliance & Workforce Language

Study how these platforms talk about:

- "Compliance training" and "risk reduction"
- "Regulation", "standards", "certifications"
- Industry-specific compliance (e.g., financial, healthcare)

> ✏️ **Action for Elevate (rewrite ideas):**
> - Add a dedicated **"Compliance & Workforce Partners"** page/section:
>   - Explain alignment with:
>     - **U.S. Department of Labor (DOL)**
>     - **Indiana Department of Workforce Development (DWD)**
>     - **WorkOne**, **EmployIndy**, and local workforce boards
>   - Mention:
>     - WIOA-aligned programs

## 5. Flows to Sketch for Elevate

For each LMS, quickly walk through:

- How a **new prospect** requests a demo / signs up
- How clearly they explain **"Who it's for"**
- What the **student/learner journey** page looks like (if shown)
- Any example **dashboards or portals** in screenshots

> ✏️ **Action for Elevate:**  
> Make wireframe notes (even simple bullets) for:
> - **Student Journey**:
>   - Discover program → Eligibility check → Apply → Orientation → Training → Certification → Job placement
> - **Agency / WorkOne Journey**:
>   - Refer a client → Track their status → Download reports for audits
> - **Employer Journey**:
>   - Request apprentices → Sign OJT/WEX agreements → View candidate progress → Hire
