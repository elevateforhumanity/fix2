## ⚠️ Current Issue

### Dev Server Not Staying Up
The `npm run dev` command starts but doesn't stay running in the background. This is a Gitpod/environment issue, not a code issue.

**Symptoms:**
- Server starts successfully
- Shows "VITE v6.3.6 ready in 326 ms"
- But terminates when command completes
- Preview URL shows "Service unavailable"

## 🔧 Solutions

### Option 1: Deploy to Production (RECOMMENDED)
The app is already built and ready. Deploy to:
- **Cloudflare Pages**: https://elevateforhumanity.pages.dev
- **Netlify**: Connect your GitHub repo
- **Vercel**: Import from GitHub

### Option 2: Use Built Version
The `/dist` folder contains the production build. You can:
1. Serve it with any static file server
2. Upload to hosting provider
3. Test locally with: `npx serve dist`

### Option 3: Manual Dev Server
Run in terminal (not via automation):
```bash
cd /workspaces/fix2
npm run dev
```
Keep the terminal open - don't close it.
