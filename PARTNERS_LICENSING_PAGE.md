**Faster, More Affordable, and Lower Risk Than Custom Development**

### Comparison Table

| Factor                    | Build In-House                 | License Elevate         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Time to Deploy**        | 12-18 months                   | 2-4 weeks               |
| **Upfront Cost**          | $300K-$500K+                   | Annual license fee      |
| **Ongoing Maintenance**   | $50K-$100K/year                | Included in license     |
| **Security & Compliance** | Your responsibility            | Built-in and maintained |
| **Updates & Features**    | Custom development             | Included automatically  |
| **Risk**                  | High (scope, timeline, budget) | Low (proven platform)   |

### Body Copy

Custom software development is expensive, time-consuming, and risky. By the time you finish building, requirements have changed and maintenance costs are mounting.

Licensing gives you immediate access to a proven platform, ongoing updates, and professional support—without the development risk or ongoing maintenance burden.
