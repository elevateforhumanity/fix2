## FINAL VERDICT

**Your site is 80% identical to Industrious Office design.**

The core structure, layout, and styling are PERFECT. You're missing:
- Press/news section (10%)
- Newsletter section (5%)
- Image logos instead of text (5%)

**To reach 100%:** Add those 3 sections (4 hours of work total)

**Current status:** Your homepage is VERY close to Industrious. The main issue is not the design match—it's the duplicate/generic images throughout the site making it look repetitive.
