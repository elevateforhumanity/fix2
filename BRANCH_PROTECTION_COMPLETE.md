# Branch Protection Setup - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented automated branch protection for the `elevateforhumanity/fix2` repository with continuous monitoring.

**Status:** ✅ Complete and Active
**Date:** October 26, 2024
**Commits:** 
- `802cc4d5` - Initial comprehensive setup
- `0925878c` - Simplified to branch protection only
- `0b5acb54` - Merged via PR #16

## What's Active

### 1. Branch Protection Rules ✅
**Applied to:** `main` branch

**Rules enforced:**
- ✅ Require pull request before merging
- ✅ Require 1 approval from reviewer
- ✅ Dismiss stale pull request approvals when new commits are pushed
- ✅ Require conversation resolution before merging
- ✅ Enforce admins (no bypassing)
- ✅ Require branches to be up to date before merging

**Verified:** Successfully blocked direct push to `main` during setup

### 2. Automated Workflows ✅

**Apply Branch Protection** (`.github/workflows/branch-protection-apply.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Manual (workflow_dispatch)
- **Purpose:** Apply/update branch protection rules
- **Requires:** `REPO_ADMIN_TOKEN` secret
- **Status:** ✅ Configured and tested

**Branch Protection Guard** (`.github/workflows/branch-protection-guard.yml`)
- **Trigger:** Push to main, nightly at 3:19 AM UTC, manual
- **Purpose:** Monitor for protection rule drift
- **Action:** Opens GitHub issue if rules are weakened
- **Status:** ✅ Active and monitoring

### 3. Automation Scripts ✅

**Setup Script** (`autopilot/branch-protection/setup-branch-protection.sh`)
- Applies branch protection via gh CLI
- Configurable via environment variables
- Can be run locally or in CI

**Audit Script** (`autopilot/branch-protection/audit-branch-protection.mjs`)
- Verifies protection settings
- Checks for required rules
- Exits with error if drift detected

## Files Deployed

└── audit-branch-protection.mjs    # Verify settings script

└── branch-protection-setup.md     # Complete documentation
```

## Configuration

### Required Secret
- **Name:** `REPO_ADMIN_TOKEN`
- **Type:** GitHub Personal Access Token
- **Scopes:** `repo` + `admin:repo_hook` (classic) OR "Repository administration: Read and write" (fine-grained)
- **Status:** ✅ Configured

### Default Settings
```bash
REPO_SLUG=elevateforhumanity/fix2
BRANCH=main
REVIEWERS=1
DISMISS_STALE=true
ENFORCE_ADMINS=true
REQUIRE_CONVO_RES=true
STRICT_UP_TO_DATE=true
```

## How It Works

### Normal Workflow
1. Developer creates feature branch
2. Makes changes and commits
3. Opens pull request to `main`
4. Gets 1 approval from reviewer
5. Resolves all conversations
6. Merges PR (branch protection enforced)

### Protection Monitoring
1. Guard workflow runs on every push to `main`
2. Also runs nightly at 3:19 AM UTC
3. Checks all protection rules are intact
4. If drift detected:
   - Opens GitHub issue
   - Provides details of missing/changed rules
   - Updates existing issue if already open

### Manual Operations

**Apply protection:**
```bash
bash autopilot/branch-protection/setup-branch-protection.sh
```

**Verify protection:**
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=$TOKEN node autopilot/branch-protection/audit-branch-protection.mjs
```

**Trigger workflows:**
- Go to Actions → Select workflow → Run workflow

## What Was Removed

For simplicity, the following were removed:
- ❌ Lighthouse CI performance testing
- ❌ Performance budgets and monitoring
- ❌ PR performance reports
- ❌ Slack/Teams notifications
- ❌ Nightly baseline publishing

**Reason:** Simplified setup focusing on essential branch protection without performance testing complexity.

## Verification

### Test 1: Direct Push Blocked ✅
```
$ git push origin main
remote: error: GH013: Repository rule violations found for refs/heads/main.
remote: - Changes must be made through a pull request.
! [remote rejected] main -> main (push declined due to repository rule violations)
```

### Test 2: PR Workflow ✅
- Created branch: `simplify/remove-lighthouse-ci`
- Opened PR #16
- Merged successfully
- Protection rules enforced

### Test 3: Bulldog Test ✅
- Created branch: `test/branch-protection-bulldog`
- Attempted direct push to main: **BLOCKED** ✅
- Pushed to feature branch: **SUCCEEDED** ✅
- Created PR #17: **REQUIRED** ✅
- Merged successfully
- All protection rules verified working

### Test 4: Guard Monitoring ✅
- Workflow configured and active
- Runs on schedule and push events
- Ready to detect drift

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- **None required** - Fully automated

### Monitoring
- Check Actions tab for guard workflow runs
- Review any issues opened by guard workflow
- Verify protection rules remain active

### Updates
If protection rules need changes:
1. Update `setup-branch-protection.sh` environment variables
2. Run "Apply Branch Protection" workflow
3. Or update manually via GitHub Settings → Branches

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Protection rules not applied
**Solution:** Run "Apply Branch Protection" workflow manually

### Issue: Guard workflow failing
**Solution:** Check workflow logs in Actions tab, verify `GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions

### Issue: Need to bypass protection (emergency)
**Solution:** 
1. Settings → Branches → Edit rule
2. Temporarily disable "Enforce admins"
3. Make emergency change
4. Re-enable immediately
