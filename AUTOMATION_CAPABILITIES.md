## ❌ WHAT I CANNOT AUTOMATE

### 1. Durable.co (No Access)

- ❌ Cannot login (requires your credentials)
- ❌ Cannot edit pages (no API)
- ❌ Cannot add custom code (web interface only)
- ❌ Cannot publish changes (authentication required)

**Why:** Third-party platform with authentication, no public API

### 2. Other Third-Party Platforms

- ❌ WordPress admin panels
- ❌ Wix editor
- ❌ Squarespace
- ❌ Any platform requiring login

**Why:** Security, authentication, bot protection

## 💡 WHY THIS MATTERS

**Durable.co is a "walled garden":**

- They control the platform
- They control access
- They control what you can automate

**Your Netlify site is "open":**

- You control everything
- I can automate everything
- No limitations

**The bridge connects them:**

- Durable = Pretty frontend (manual edits)
- Netlify = Dynamic backend (fully automated)
- Bridge = Makes them work together

## 🎯 NEXT STEPS

**Tell me which option you want:**

1. **"I'll add the bridge script"** → I'll wait and verify it works
2. **"Give me static HTML"** → I'll generate it now
3. **"Build me a custom site"** → I'll start building on Netlify
