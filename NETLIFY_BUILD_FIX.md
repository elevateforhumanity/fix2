# Netlify Build Fix - Ready to Deploy

## ‚úÖ All Configuration Correct

Your Netlify setup is already properly configured:

### netlify.toml ‚úÖ
```toml
[build]
  command = "pnpm install && pnpm run build"
  publish = "dist"
  functions = "netlify/functions"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20.11.1"  ‚úÖ Modern Node
  PNPM_VERSION = "9.7.0"
  VITE_SUPABASE_URL = "..." ‚úÖ Set
  VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "..." ‚úÖ Set
```

### public/_redirects ‚úÖ
```
/* /index.html 200  ‚úÖ SPA fallback
```

### package.json ‚úÖ
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "node scripts/check-env.js && vite build"  ‚úÖ Correct
  }
}
```

### vite.config.js ‚úÖ (JUST FIXED)
```javascript
build: {
  sourcemap: false,  ‚úÖ Fixed - was causing build failure
}
```

## The Fix

**Problem:** Sourcemaps were enabled (`sourcemap: true`) causing Netlify build to fail

   - Add in Netlify: Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`

2. **Supabase Migrations** (for database)
   - Run 4 SQL files in Supabase dashboard
   - Enables scholarship applications, enrollment tracking

3. **Optional:** OpenAI, Sentry, Slack (for advanced features)
