---

## üí∞ BOTTOM LINE

### **Realistic Sale Price: $150K - $350K**

### **Most Likely Buyers:**

1. Workforce development companies (60% chance)
2. EdTech startups (40% chance)
3. Community colleges (30% chance)
4. PE firms (20% chance)
5. Microsoft/Google (5% chance)

### **Microsoft Specifically:**

- **Chance they'd buy:** 5%
- **Price they'd pay:** $1M - $3M (if interested)
- **Why unlikely:** Too small, no revenue, prefer to build internally
- **How to increase chances:** Get 10,000+ users and $500K+ revenue first

### **Best Strategy:**

1. Get 10-20 beta users (1 month)
2. Contact 20-30 workforce development companies
3. Target $200K - $400K sale price
4. Close in 3-4 months

### **Alternative:**

- Keep it, launch properly, get to $500K revenue
- Then sell for $2M - $5M in 12-18 months

---

**The harsh truth:** Without users/revenue, you're selling potential, not proof.
$150K-$350K is realistic. $1M+ requires traction.

**The opportunity:** Even at $150K, that's a great return for code.
At $350K, it's excellent. But at $2M+ (with traction), it's life-changing.

---

**Recommendation:** Spend 2-3 months getting 100-500 users, then sell for $500K-$1M.
Or sell now for $150K-$350K and move on.

Your call.
