# Positioning Statement

**The One-Liner That Wins Every Room**

---

## Core Positioning (Use Everywhere)

> **"We license the infrastructure that allows organizations to operate compliant, funded apprenticeship programs — without becoming a school or building systems from scratch."**

---

## Why This Works

### 1. Clarity

**"We license the infrastructure"**

- Not a service. Not a school. Not consulting.
- It's software. It's scalable. It's licensable.

### 2. Value Proposition

**"compliant, funded apprenticeship programs"**

- Solves the two biggest pain points: compliance and funding
- Addresses the core need: apprenticeships that work

### 3. Differentiation

**"without becoming a school or building systems from scratch"**

- Eliminates the two biggest barriers
- Makes the impossible possible

### 4. Target Audience

**"organizations"**

- Broad enough: employers, agencies, colleges, tribes
- Specific enough: not individuals, not consumers

## Objection Pre-Emption

### "Sounds complicated."

**Response:** "That's exactly why we exist. We handle the complexity so you don't have to."

### "Sounds expensive."

**Response:** "Our fees are for software and admin infrastructure only — never wages or training. Most clients save money compared to traditional training."

### "We already have a system."

**Response:** "Most systems aren't built for apprenticeships. We handle RAPIDS, ETPL, and multi-state compliance automatically."

### "We're not ready."

**Response:** "We can start small with a pilot. One employer, one apprentice. Prove the model, then scale."

### "This sounds too good to be true."

**Response:** "It's a federal program that's been around for decades. We just make it accessible. We're a registered sponsor, ETPL-approved, and fully compliant."
