---

> **"All fees charged by Elevate for Humanity are for software access, administrative infrastructure, and compliance support only. No grant funds are used for wages, training delivery, participant stipends, or employer payroll unless expressly authorized by the funding agency."**

## Key Messages

### For Employers

**"You train. We handle the system."**

Training may be funded. Tools may be covered. Tax credits possible. You focus on your business — we handle compliance.

### For Workforce Agencies

**"We reduce friction — not add to it."**

Employer-driven placements. Clean compliance. Audit-ready records. Reduced staff workload. Scalable model.

### For States

**"We don't compete with the workforce system. We extend it."**

Deploy sponsor-in-a-box. Expand apprenticeships quickly. Maintain policy control. Avoid new systems procurement.

### For Investors

**"This is infrastructure, not a training company."**

Licensable SaaS platform. Strong unit economics. Defensible moat. Clear exit path. Market tailwinds.

## Objection Handling

### "We already have a system."

**Response:** "Most systems aren't built for apprenticeships. We handle RAPIDS registration, ETPL reporting, and multi-state compliance automatically. Happy to show you a comparison."

### "This sounds expensive."

**Response:** "Our fees are for software and admin infrastructure only — never wages or training. Most clients save $15k-$25k per apprentice compared to traditional training. We pay for ourselves."

### "We don't have budget."

**Response:** "Many clients use WIOA admin funds or employer fees to cover our costs. We can help you structure a budget-neutral model."

### "We're not ready yet."

**Response:** "We can start small with a pilot. One employer, one apprentice. Prove the model, then scale. What would make you ready?"

### "What if it doesn't work?"

**Response:** "We have a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you're not satisfied, we'll refund your setup fee and cancel with no penalty. Zero risk."
