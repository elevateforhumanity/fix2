## Employer Objection Handling

### "I don't have time for this."

**Response:** "That's exactly why we exist. You train like you normally would. We handle all the paperwork, compliance, and reporting. Most employers spend less than 2 hours per month on this."

### "I can't afford it."

**Response:** "Training is often funded, tools may be covered, and you may qualify for tax credits. Many employers save $15k-$25k in the first year compared to hiring experienced workers."

### "What if they quit?"

**Response:** "Apprentices have higher retention because they're invested in the training. If someone does leave, we help you find a replacement. You maintain normal employer rights throughout."

### "I don't want to deal with the state."

**Response:** "You won't. We're the registered sponsor. We handle all state reporting, compliance, and audits. You never talk to the state unless you want to."

### "This sounds too good to be true."

**Response:** "It's a federal program that's been around for decades. We just make it accessible. We're a registered sponsor, ETPL-approved, and fully compliant. Happy to connect you with other employers who are doing this."
