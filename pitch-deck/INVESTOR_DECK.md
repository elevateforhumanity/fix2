## Slide 2 — What You've Built

### A Licensable Workforce Operating System

For apprenticeship sponsors, workforce agencies, and intermediaries.

**This is not:**

- ❌ A school
- ❌ A staffing agency
- ❌ A training provider

**This is:**

- ✅ Infrastructure
- ✅ Compliance automation
- ✅ B2B SaaS platform
- ✅ Multi-state scalable

---

## Slide 3 — The Problem

### Four Broken Systems

**Employers:**

- Want apprenticeships
- Won't manage compliance
- Can't navigate funding

**Agencies:**

- Want outcomes
- Don't want new systems
- Drowning in paperwork

**Sponsors:**

- Stuck in spreadsheets
- Manual reporting
- Can't scale

**Audits:**

- Painful
- Risky
- Time-consuming

**Result:** Massive market opportunity with no dominant player.

---

## Slide 4 — The Solution

# Sponsor-in-a-Box

### Complete Infrastructure Platform

1. **Apprenticeship Registration** — RAPIDS integration, automated filing
2. **Funding Alignment** — WIOA, WRG, OJT, WOTC tracking
3. **Employer Onboarding** — Agreements, MOUs, training plans
4. **Audit-Ready Reporting** — SOC-style controls, one-click exports
5. **Multi-State Rules** — Configurable compliance engine
6. **White-Label SaaS** — Rebrandable for partners

---

## Slide 5 — Market Size

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

**Registered Apprenticeships (US):**

- 25,000+ active sponsors
- 600,000+ active apprentices
- $1B+ in administrative spend

**Workforce Agencies:**

- 550+ American Job Centers
- 2,500+ WorkOne/One-Stop locations
- $3B+ WIOA funding annually

**Intermediaries:**

- 1,000+ community colleges
- 500+ workforce boards
- 200+ tribal nations

**TAM:** $5B+ addressable market

---

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

**Target Segments:**

- Small-to-medium sponsors (5-250 apprentices)
- Regional workforce boards
- Community college non-credit divisions
- Tribal workforce programs

**SAM:** $500M-$1B

---

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

**Year 1-3 Focus:**

- Midwest states (IN, OH, KY, IL, MI, WI)
- Skilled trades (barbering, HVAC, construction)
- 100-500 enterprise clients

**SOM:** $50M-$100M (5-10% of SAM)

---

## Slide 6 — Revenue Model

### Four Revenue Streams

**1. Platform Licensing (SaaS)**

- Monthly subscription per tenant
- Tiered pricing (Starter, Pro, Enterprise)
- Recurring, predictable revenue

**2. Employer Admin Fees**

- Per-apprentice monthly fee
- Covers compliance, reporting, support
- Scales with volume

**3. White-Label Contracts**

- Annual licensing for partners
- Customization and integration fees
- High-margin, sticky revenue

**4. State/Tribal Enterprise**

- Multi-year contracts
- Statewide infrastructure
- $100k-$500k+ per contract

**Key:** No dependency on grant funds. Revenue from infrastructure, not training.
