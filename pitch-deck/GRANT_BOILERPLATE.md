## Organizational Description

### Standard Version

Elevate for Humanity is a registered apprenticeship sponsor and workforce intermediary providing compliance infrastructure, reporting, and administrative support for employer-driven earn-and-learn programs.

### Extended Version

Elevate for Humanity operates as a registered apprenticeship sponsor under the National Apprenticeship Act, providing workforce infrastructure that enables employers, workforce agencies, and community partners to launch compliant, funded apprenticeship programs without becoming schools or building systems from scratch.

Our platform integrates with RAPIDS (Registered Apprenticeship Partners Information Data System), ETPL (Eligible Training Provider List) performance tracking, and state workforce funding systems to deliver audit-ready compliance, closed-loop reporting, and scalable program administration.

---

## Program Model

### Standard Version

Participants are hired by employers and complete paid, supervised on-the-job training combined with related technical instruction coordinated through approved providers. Apprenticeships are registered and tracked in RAPIDS, with outcomes monitored for ETPL performance.

### Extended Version

Our apprenticeship model follows the earn-and-learn framework:

1. **Employer Hiring:** Participants are hired directly by host employers as W-2 employees
2. **On-the-Job Training:** Supervised work experience following approved training plans
3. **Related Technical Instruction:** Coordinated through approved providers (community colleges, trade schools, online platforms)
4. **Wage Progression:** Structured increases tied to competency milestones
5. **Credential Attainment:** Industry-recognized credentials upon completion
6. **Compliance Tracking:** All activities logged in RAPIDS and monitored for ETPL performance

This model aligns with WIOA, Wagner-Peyser, and state workforce development priorities while maintaining employer control and participant employment stability.

## Common Grant Questions (Responses)

### How is this different from traditional training programs?

Apprenticeships are earn-and-learn models where participants are employed and paid from day one. Training happens on the job, reducing costs and increasing retention. Employers drive the training, ensuring relevance and job placement.

### How do you ensure quality training?

All apprenticeships follow registered standards approved by [State Apprenticeship Agency / USDOL]. Training plans specify competencies, hours, and assessments. Employers are vetted for capacity and commitment. Progress is monitored through RAPIDS and platform tracking.

### What happens if a participant drops out?

We provide intensive case management and supportive services to prevent dropout. If a participant exits, we work with workforce agencies to transition them to other opportunities or re-enroll them when barriers are resolved.

### How do you measure success?

Success is measured through WIOA performance indicators: employment rates, credential attainment, wage gains, and measurable skill gains. We also track employer satisfaction and long-term retention.

### How do you serve priority populations?

We partner with community organizations, re-entry programs, and workforce agencies to recruit and support priority populations. Supportive services address barriers. Employers are trained on inclusive hiring practices.

### What is your track record?

[Insert actual data when available. Example:]

- [x] apprentices enrolled
- [X]% retention rate
- [X]% completion rate
- [X]% employed at completion
