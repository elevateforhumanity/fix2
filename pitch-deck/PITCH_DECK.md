## Speaker Notes

### Slide 1 — Cover

"Good morning. I'm here to show you how we're making registered apprenticeship accessible, compliant, and scalable for employers and workforce agencies across Indiana and beyond."

### Slide 2 — Problem

"You already know these challenges. Employers want workers now, but traditional training takes too long. Compliance scares them off. Your staff is stretched thin. And when audits come, everyone scrambles."

### Slide 3 — Solution

"We provide the sponsorship and infrastructure that lets you launch earn-and-learn programs without building new systems or becoming a school."

### Slide 4 — What We Are

"Let me be clear about what we are and what we're not. We're a registered sponsor, ETPL-approved, and fully compatible with WIOA and WRG. We're not a staffing agency, not a school, and we don't control funding."

### Slide 5 — How It Works

"Here's the model: Employer agrees to host. Participant gets hired and paid. We coordinate training. Funding layers in where eligible. We handle all compliance centrally. Result: lower cost, lower risk, higher retention."

### Slide 6 — Programs

"We started with barber apprenticeships in Indiana. We've expanded to skilled trades, and we're building healthcare and business tracks. Every program plugs into RAPIDS, ETPL, and your funding rules."

### Slide 7 — Employer Value

"Employers get paid apprentices, funded training, tools covered, possible wage reimbursement, possible tax credits, one point of contact, and full compliance support. That's why they say yes."

### Slide 8 — Agency Value

"For workforce partners, you get employer-driven placements, clean compliance, audit-ready records, closed-loop reporting, reduced staff workload, and a scalable model. We reduce friction, not add to it."

### Slide 9 — Compliance

"Compliance is built in. RAPIDS tracking, ETPL dashboards, funding status, WOTC deadlines, OJT tracking, audit logs, one-click exports. When monitoring comes, you're ready."

### Slide 10 — Why It Works

"This works because employers say yes faster, participants earn while they learn, agencies keep control, audits are calm, and programs scale without reinvention."

### Slide 11 — Proven

"This isn't a pilot. Sponsor authority is established. ETPL is active. Funding compatibility is live. Employer onboarding is standardized. Multi-state expansion is built. This is infrastructure."

### Slide 12 — How States Use This

"States can deploy this as sponsor-in-a-box, expand apprenticeships quickly, support priority populations, maintain policy control, and avoid new systems procurement."

### Slide 13 — Partnerships

"We work with regional boards, state agencies, tribal nations, nonprofits, and community colleges. We're designed to fit into your existing ecosystem."

### Slide 14 — Pricing

"Pricing is transparent. Platform licensing and admin fees only. No training, wages, or grant funds are billed. Tiered pricing based on volume. Details provided separately."

### Slide 15 — Close

"We don't compete with the workforce system. We extend it. We license the infrastructure that allows you to operate compliant, funded apprenticeship programs without becoming a school or building systems from scratch. Let's discuss how this fits your region."

## Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions

**Q: How is this different from a community college program?**  
A: We're not a school. We're a sponsor and infrastructure provider. Employers hire directly. Training is coordinated, not delivered by us. We handle compliance and funding coordination.

**Q: Who pays for what?**  
A: Employers pay wages. Training may be funded through WIOA/WRG. Tools/kits may be covered as supportive services. Our platform fees are for software and admin infrastructure only.

**Q: What if an employer drops out?**  
A: We have employer agreements and MOUs in place. If an employer exits, we work with the workforce agency to find a new placement or transition the apprentice.

**Q: How do you handle multi-state expansion?**  
A: We have a rules engine that adapts to state-specific requirements. Each state's policies are configured in the system.

**Q: What's your success rate?**  
A: [Insert actual data when available] We track completion rates, credential attainment, and employment retention through ETPL reporting.

**Q: Can we white-label this?**  
A: Yes, on Professional and Enterprise plans. Your branding, your domain, our infrastructure.

**Q: How long does implementation take?**  
A: Starter: 2-4 weeks. Professional: 4-8 weeks. Enterprise: 8-12 weeks (includes custom configuration).

**Q: What about data security?**  
A: SOC 2 Type II controls, encrypted data, role-based access, audit logs, FERPA/WIOA compliance.
