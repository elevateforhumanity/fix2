## DEMO SCRIPT (45 minutes)

### Introduction (5 min)

```
"Thanks for joining! Here's what we'll cover today:

1. Quick intro to Elevate for Humanity
2. The problem we solve
3. Live demo of the platform
4. Pricing and next steps
5. Your questions

Sound good? Let's dive in.

WHO WE ARE:
We're a nonprofit that helps workforce training organizations access WIOA funding and automate compliance. We've built a platform that wraps around your existing operations.

WHO WE SERVE:
Small nonprofits, community organizations, and existing ETPL providers.

WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT:
We don't replace your business - we enhance it. You keep your students, staff, and processes. We add technology, credentials (if you need them), and compliance automation."
```

### Problem (5 min)

```
"Let me share what we hear from organizations like yours:

PROBLEM 1: Can't access WIOA funding
- Small nonprofits don't have ETPL credentials
- Application process is complex and expensive
- Without credentials, students can't get tuition assistance

PROBLEM 2: Compliance is manual and time-consuming
- Indiana DWD requires quarterly reports
- Data entry takes 20+ hours per month
- One missed deadline = removal from ETPL

PROBLEM 3: Technology is outdated or non-existent
- Using spreadsheets or old LMS
- No mobile access for students
- Manual processes everywhere

Sound familiar?"
```

### Solution - Live Demo (25 min)

**Part 1: Licensing Options (3 min)**

```
[Share screen: /pricing/platform]

"We offer two paths:

PATH 1: Program Holder Network

- We handle compliance automation
- $2K-$15K/month based on size

PATH 2: Independent Platform
- For organizations WITH credentials
- You license our technology
- You keep your credentials
- $2K-$10K/month

Which path fits you better?"
```

**Part 2: Student Enrollment (5 min)**

Questions so far?"
```

**Part 3: Compliance Dashboard (7 min)**

```
[Share screen: Compliance dashboard]

See this dashboard? It shows:
- Upcoming report deadlines

[Point to each section]

The system automatically checks your data every day.

If a report is due in 7 days, you get an alert.
If your employment rate drops below 70%, you get an alert.
If data is missing, you get an alert.

You never miss a deadline.

[Click on an alert]

See? It tells you exactly what to do and when.

Your students are already on their phones. Meet them where they are."

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "Too expensive"

```
"I understand budget is important. Let's look at ROI:

With WIOA funding access, your students can get $3K-$10K in tuition assistance.

If you enroll just 10 more students per year because of this, that's $30K-$100K in additional revenue.

The platform pays for itself many times over.

Plus, we offer a FREE 90-day pilot. Try it risk-free."
```

### "Need to think about it"

```
"Absolutely, this is an important decision.

What specific concerns do you have? Let's address them now so you have all the information you need.

Is it pricing? Features? Implementation? Something else?"
```

### "Need board approval"

```
"That makes sense. What information does your board need?

I can provide:
- Board presentation (10 slides)
- ROI analysis
- References from similar organizations
- Legal review of MOU

What would be most helpful?"
```

### "Already have a system"

```
"Great! What system are you using?

Our platform wraps around your existing operations. You don't have to replace everything.

Many customers start with just compliance automation, then add more features over time.

What's your biggest pain point with your current system?"
```

### "Not sure about credential sharing"

```
"That's a fair concern. We're getting legal validation now from an attorney who specializes in education law.

Also, we offer an Independent Platform option where you keep your own credentials and just license our technology.

Would that be a better fit?"
```
