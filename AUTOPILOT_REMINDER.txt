ðŸ¤– AUTOPILOT SETUP REMINDER

ONE-TIME MANUAL STEP REQUIRED:

Supabase security requires you to paste SQL into their dashboard.
This is a one-time setup, then autopilot handles everything.

WHAT TO DO:
1. Open: COMPLETE_SETUP.sql (should be open in your editor)
2. Copy ALL contents (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk/sql/new
4. Paste (Ctrl+V)
5. Click "Run"
6. Done!

AFTER THIS:
- Autopilot handles all future updates
- No more manual steps
- Everything automated

WHY THIS STEP:
Supabase doesn't allow automated table creation via API (security).
This is industry standard for database security.

VERIFY:
Run: pnpm autopilot:migrate
Should show: âœ… DATABASE ALREADY CONFIGURED!
