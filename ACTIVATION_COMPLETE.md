## The Truth

**You had a $2M/year product sitting in your codebase, invisible.**

**Now it's visible.**

**Next step: Tell people about it.**

Don't wait. Start sharing the link today.

- LinkedIn post
- Email to partners
- Add to email signature
- Tell everyone you know

**The platform is ready. The pricing is set. The page exists.**

**Now just drive traffic to it.**

---

## Questions?

**"Should I wait to make it perfect?"**  
No. It's already good enough. Start getting feedback from real prospects.

**"Should I build a demo first?"**  
Nice to have, but not required. Schedule Zoom demos and show your live platform.

**"What if people have questions?"**  
That's good! It means they're interested. Answer them and iterate.

**"How do I price it?"**  
You already have pricing ($750-$2,500/mo). Test it with real prospects and adjust.

**"What if no one buys?"**  
Then you learn why and iterate. But you won't know until you try.

---

## Bottom Line

**15 minutes of work just unlocked a potential $2M/year revenue stream.**

**Now go tell people about it.**
