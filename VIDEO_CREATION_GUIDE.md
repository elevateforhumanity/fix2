### EMPLOYER ORIENTATION VIDEOS

#### Video 1: Welcome to Elevate for Humanity (10 min)
```
[SCRIPT]

Hello and welcome to Elevate for Humanity! I'm excited to have you join our network of employer partners.

At Elevate, we believe that everyone deserves access to quality career training and meaningful employment. Our mission is to connect job seekers with the skills they need, and employers like you with the trained talent you're looking for.

Here's what makes our partnership valuable:

First, we provide 100% free training to job seekers through WIOA funding, Workforce Ready Grants, and other state programs. This means candidates come to you already trained, certified, and ready to work.

Second, we handle all the recruitment, screening, and training. You get access to motivated, job-ready candidates without the cost and time of traditional hiring.

Third, we track outcomes. We follow up with both you and the employee to ensure successful placements and address any issues early.

Our programs cover high-demand fields: healthcare, skilled trades, beauty and wellness, business, and technology. From CNAs to HVAC technicians, from barbers to medical assistants - we're training people for real jobs that exist right now in Indianapolis.

As an employer partner, you'll have access to our employer portal where you can post jobs, review candidates, schedule interviews, and track your hires. We'll walk through all of that in the next videos.

Thank you for partnering with us to create opportunities and change lives. Let's get started!

#### Video 2: Employer Portal Overview (15 min)
```
[SCRIPT]

Welcome to your Employer Portal walkthrough. Let me show you how to navigate and use all the features available to you.

When you first log in, you'll see your dashboard. This is your command center for all hiring activities.

At the top, you'll see key metrics: active job postings, new applications, scheduled interviews, and recent hires. These update in real-time.

On the left sidebar, you have your main navigation:
- Dashboard (where we are now)
- Job Postings
- Candidates
- Interviews
- Hired Employees
- Reports
- Settings

Let's click on Job Postings. Here you can see all your active, draft, and closed job postings. The green badge shows active postings that candidates can see. Yellow means draft - you're still working on it. Gray means closed.

Click "Post New Job" to create a posting. We'll cover that in detail in the next video.

Now let's look at Candidates. This is where you review applications. You can filter by program, date applied, status, and more. Each candidate card shows their photo, name, program completed, certifications earned, and a brief summary.

Click on any candidate to see their full profile: resume, certifications, work history, references, and assessment scores. You can message them directly, schedule an interview, or move them to the next stage.

The Interviews section shows your upcoming and past interviews. You can schedule new interviews, send calendar invites, and add notes after each interview.

Hired Employees tracks everyone you've hired through Elevate. We use this for outcome reporting and to measure program success. You'll update their status here: actively employed, promoted, left company, etc.

Reports give you insights into your hiring activity, time-to-hire, retention rates, and more. You can export these for your records.

Settings is where you manage your company profile, notification preferences, and team members who have access to the portal.

That's your employer portal overview. In the next video, we'll walk through posting your first job opening step by step.

### STAFF ORIENTATION VIDEOS

#### Video 1: Welcome to the Elevate Team (10 min)
```
[SCRIPT]

Welcome to the Elevate for Humanity team! Whether you're an instructor, coach, case manager, or administrator, you play a vital role in transforming lives through education and employment.

Our mission is simple but powerful: Innovate, Elevate, and Reset lives. We do this by providing free career training, supportive services, and pathways to employment for people who need it most.

You'll be working with diverse populations: young adults starting their careers, career changers looking for new opportunities, re-entry participants rebuilding their lives, and workforce clients referred by partner agencies.

Every student you work with has a story. Some are overcoming barriers like lack of transportation, childcare challenges, or past mistakes. Others are simply looking for a better opportunity. Your role is to meet them where they are and help them get where they want to go.

Here's what we expect from every team member:

First, professionalism. You represent Elevate in everything you do. Show up on time, communicate clearly, and maintain appropriate boundaries.

Second, documentation. Accurate record-keeping is essential for compliance, funding, and student success. We'll show you exactly what to document and how.

Third, student-centered approach. Our students are not numbers. Learn their names, understand their goals, and celebrate their wins.

Fourth, collaboration. You're part of a team. Communicate with colleagues, share concerns early, and support each other.

Fifth, continuous improvement. We're always learning and getting better. Provide feedback, suggest improvements, and stay open to new approaches.

You'll have access to our staff portal, which we'll tour in the next video. This is your hub for managing students, courses, attendance, and all the tools you need to do your job effectively.

We're glad you're here. Let's make an impact together!

```
[SCRIPT]

Welcome to the Elevate for Humanity partner network! As a training provider, you're joining a ecosystem that connects your expertise with students who need it and funding that makes it possible.

Here's how our partnership works:

You provide the training. You're the expert in your field - whether that's healthcare, trades, beauty, or business. You create the curriculum, deliver the instruction, and certify the students.

We provide the students. Through our partnerships with WorkOne, workforce boards, and community organizations, we recruit students who are motivated, funded, and ready to learn.

We handle the administration. Enrollment, payment processing, compliance reporting, and student support - we take care of the operational details so you can focus on teaching.

You receive 1/3 of the net revenue after books and fees. We handle marketing, enrollment, materials, and collections, and you get paid reliably and on time.

Here's what makes this partnership valuable for you:

First, consistent enrollment. No more worrying about filling classes. We send you qualified students who are ready to start.

Second, guaranteed payment. Students are funded through WIOA, WRG, or other programs. You don't chase payments or deal with collections.

Third, compliance support. We help you navigate WIOA requirements, state regulations, and reporting obligations.

Fourth, marketing reach. Your programs are promoted through our website, partner network, and community connections.

Fifth, quality standards. We maintain high standards for all partners, which elevates the reputation of everyone in the network.

In the next videos, we'll walk through setting up your account, creating your first course, managing enrollments, and tracking your revenue.

We're excited to partner with you. Let's build something great together!
