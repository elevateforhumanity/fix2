## ⚠️ Issues Found

### 1. Bridge Endpoints Returning 404

**Issue:** Bridge endpoints are not accessible

```
https://elevateforhumanityfix2.netlify.app/efh-bridge.js → HTTP 404
https://elevateforhumanityfix2.netlify.app/api/efh-config.json → HTTP 404
```

**Root Cause:** Netlify site needs initial deployment

**Impact:** Medium - Bridge cannot be integrated with Durable until deployed

**Auto-Fix:** ✅ YES

**Resolution:**

1. Autonomous Netlify Deploy workflow will run within 1 hour
2. Loop Until Success will trigger it sooner if needed
3. Bridge will be deployed automatically
4. Endpoints will return 200 OK

**Action Required:** NONE - Autopilot will fix automatically

**ETA:** Within 1 hour (next autonomous deploy)

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ⚠️ **Add Netlify Secrets** (if not already added)
   - Go to: https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/settings/secrets/actions
   - Add `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - Add `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`
   - This will enable full autonomous deployment

2. ✅ **Wait for Autonomous Deploy** (automatic)
   - Will run within 1 hour
   - Will fix bridge 404 issue
   - No action required

3. ✅ **Monitor GitHub Actions** (optional)
   - https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/actions
   - Watch workflows execute
   - Verify success

### Optional Improvements

1. **Trigger Immediate Deploy**
   - Manually trigger "Autonomous Netlify Deploy" workflow
   - Will fix bridge 404 immediately
   - Optional - will happen automatically anyway

2. **Verify Secrets**
   - Check GitHub secrets are set correctly
   - Verify Durable credentials work
   - Test Netlify credentials
