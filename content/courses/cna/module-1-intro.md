- CNAs assist with daily living activities
- Focus on maintaining quality of life and dignity
- **Typical duties:** Bathing, dressing, feeding, toileting, mobility assistance

- Acute care settings for patients with immediate medical needs
- CNAs work under RN supervision on medical-surgical units
- Fast-paced environment requiring quick response
- **Typical duties:** Vital signs, patient transport, specimen collection, documentation

#### Home Health Care
- One-on-one care in patient's home
- More independence and relationship-building
- Travel between patient homes
- **Typical duties:** Personal care, light housekeeping, meal preparation, companionship

#### Assisted Living Facilities

### The CNA Scope of Practice

#### What CNAs CAN Do:
✅ Take and record vital signs (temperature, pulse, respiration, blood pressure)  
✅ Assist with activities of daily living (ADLs): bathing, dressing, grooming, toileting  
✅ Help with mobility: transferring, ambulating, positioning  
✅ Provide basic wound care (under supervision)  
✅ Collect specimens (urine, stool, sputum)  
✅ Document care provided  
✅ Report changes in patient condition to nurse  
✅ Provide emotional support and companionship  

#### What CNAs CANNOT Do:
❌ Administer medications (except in some states with additional training)  
❌ Perform sterile procedures  
❌ Make nursing diagnoses  
❌ Create care plans (but can provide input)  
❌ Give medical advice  
❌ Accept orders from anyone except licensed nurses or physicians  

### The Healthcare Team

CNAs are vital members of the healthcare team:

**Registered Nurses (RNs)** - Your direct supervisor, creates care plans, administers medications  
**Licensed Practical Nurses (LPNs)** - Provide basic nursing care, may supervise CNAs  
**Physicians** - Diagnose and treat medical conditions  
**Physical Therapists** - Help patients regain mobility and strength  
**Occupational Therapists** - Help patients perform daily activities  
**Social Workers** - Assist with discharge planning and family support  
**Dietary Staff** - Plan and prepare therapeutic diets  

**Your role:** You are the eyes and ears of the nursing staff. You spend the most time with patients and are often the first to notice changes in their condition.

### Career Pathways

Starting as a CNA opens doors to many healthcare careers:

1. **CNA → LPN** (1 year program)
2. **CNA → RN** (2-4 year program)
3. **CNA → Medical Assistant** (1 year program)
4. **CNA → Phlebotomist** (short certification)
5. **CNA → Patient Care Technician** (additional training)
6. **CNA → Home Health Aide** (similar role, different setting)

Many employers offer tuition assistance for CNAs pursuing nursing degrees.

### Key Takeaways
- CNAs work in diverse healthcare settings

### Ethical Dilemmas

**Scenario 3: You Witness Coworker Being Rough with Patient**
- **Right approach:** Report immediately to supervisor
- **Wrong approach:** Ignore it or only confront the coworker

**Scenario 4: Patient Offers You Money or Gifts**
- **Right approach:** Politely decline, report to supervisor
- **Wrong approach:** Accept gifts (can be considered exploitation)

### Abuse and Neglect

#### Types of Abuse:
- **Physical** - Hitting, pushing, rough handling, restraining
- **Emotional** - Yelling, threatening, humiliating, ignoring
- **Sexual** - Inappropriate touching, comments, exposure

#### Signs of Abuse:

**If you suspect abuse, report immediately to your supervisor and follow facility protocol.**

### Communication with Healthcare Team
