## Lesson 5.1: Basic Nutrition Principles

### Learning Objectives
- Identify the six essential nutrients
- Understand MyPlate dietary guidelines
- Recognize signs of malnutrition and dehydration
- Explain common therapeutic diets

### The Six Essential Nutrients

#### 1. Carbohydrates
**Function:** Primary energy source  
**Sources:** Grains, bread, pasta, rice, fruits, vegetables  
**Types:**
- Simple carbs (sugars) - Quick energy
- Complex carbs (starches, fiber) - Sustained energy

#### 2. Proteins
**Function:** Build and repair tissues, make enzymes and hormones  
**Sources:** Meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, nuts  
**Complete proteins:** Contain all essential amino acids (animal sources)  
**Incomplete proteins:** Missing some amino acids (plant sources)

#### 3. Fats
**Function:** Energy storage, vitamin absorption, cell structure  
**Sources:** Oils, butter, nuts, avocados, fatty fish  
**Types:**
- Saturated fats - Solid at room temperature (limit intake)
- Unsaturated fats - Liquid at room temperature (healthier choice)
- Trans fats - Avoid (increase heart disease risk)

#### 4. Vitamins
**Function:** Regulate body processes  
**Types:**
- Fat-soluble (A, D, E, K) - Stored in body
- Water-soluble (B, C) - Not stored, need daily intake

**Key Vitamins:**
- Vitamin A - Vision, immune function
- Vitamin C - Wound healing, immune function
- Vitamin D - Bone health, calcium absorption
- Vitamin K - Blood clotting
- B Vitamins - Energy metabolism, nerve function

#### 5. Minerals
**Function:** Build bones, regulate body processes  
**Key Minerals:**
- Calcium - Bone and teeth health
- Iron - Oxygen transport in blood
- Potassium - Heart and muscle function
- Sodium - Fluid balance (limit intake)
- Zinc - Immune function, wound healing

#### 6. Water
**Function:** Most essential nutrient  
**Importance:**
- Regulates body temperature
- Transports nutrients
- Removes waste
- Lubricates joints
- Maintains blood volume

**Daily Needs:** 64 ounces (8 cups) minimum for adults

### MyPlate Dietary Guidelines

**Plate Composition:**
- **Fruits:** 1/4 of plate
- **Vegetables:** 1/4 of plate
- **Grains:** 1/4 of plate (half should be whole grains)
- **Protein:** 1/4 of plate (lean meats, beans, nuts)
- **Dairy:** 1 cup with meal (milk, yogurt, cheese)

**Key Messages:**
- Make half your plate fruits and vegetables
- Make half your grains whole grains

## Lesson 5.3: Feeding Assistance and Intake/Output

### Feeding Assistance

**Preparation:**
1. Check diet order and allergies
2. Perform hand hygiene
3. Help patient to sitting position (45-90 degrees)
4. Provide oral care if needed
5. Assist with hand washing
6. Place tray within reach
7. Open containers, cut food, butter bread
8. Place clothing protector if desired (never call it "bib")
9. Describe food on tray

**Feeding Procedure:**
1. Sit at patient's eye level
2. Tell patient what food you're offering
3. Use teaspoon (easier to manage than tablespoon)
4. Fill spoon 1/2 to 2/3 full
5. Feed from tip of spoon
6. Alternate foods (don't give all of one food first)
7. Offer fluids between bites
8. Allow adequate time to chew and swallow
9. Watch for signs of choking or difficulty swallowing
10. Wipe mouth as needed
11. Engage in pleasant conversation
12. Never rush

**After Meal:**
1. Remove tray
2. Provide oral care
3. Assist with hand washing
4. Position comfortably
5. Document intake

### Aspiration Prevention

**Aspiration:** Food or liquid entering airway and lungs (can cause pneumonia)

**Risk Factors:**
- Difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
- Unconsciousness or decreased alertness
- Stroke
- Parkinson's disease
- Dementia
- Weak cough
- Poor dentition

**Prevention Strategies:**
1. Position upright (45-90 degrees) during and 30 minutes after meals
2. Feed slowly
3. Give small bites
4. Ensure patient swallows before next bite
5. Thicken liquids if ordered
6. Avoid straws (can cause choking)
7. Provide foods appropriate for diet order
8. Stay with patient during meal
9. Encourage patient to tuck chin when swallowing

**Signs of Aspiration:**
- Coughing or choking during eating
- Wet or gurgling voice
- Difficulty breathing
- Turning blue
- Refusing to eat

**If aspiration occurs:**
1. Stop feeding immediately
2. Call for help
3. Stay with patient
4. If choking, perform Heimlich maneuver
5. Report to nurse immediately

### Thickened Liquids

**Consistency Levels:**
- **Nectar-thick** - Coats spoon, drips slowly
- **Honey-thick** - Flows slowly off spoon
- **Pudding-thick** - Holds shape on spoon

**Purpose:** Slows liquid flow, easier to control, reduces aspiration risk

**Important:**
- Use correct thickness as ordered
- Mix thoroughly
- Let sit 1-2 minutes after mixing
- Don't thin with regular liquid
- Offer frequently (patients may drink less)

### Intake and Output (I&O) Monitoring

**Intake:** All fluids entering body  
**Output:** All fluids leaving body

**Why Monitor:**
- Assess hydration status
- Monitor kidney function
- Evaluate fluid balance
- Guide treatment decisions

**Intake Includes:**
- All oral fluids (water, juice, milk, coffee, tea, soda)
- Foods that are liquid at room temperature (ice cream, gelatin, popsicles, soup)
- IV fluids (recorded by nurse)
- Tube feeding (recorded by nurse)

**Output Includes:**
- Urine
- Vomit (emesis)
- Diarrhea
- Wound drainage (recorded by nurse)
- Blood loss (recorded by nurse)

**Measuring Intake:**
1. Know container sizes:
   - Cup: 6-8 oz (180-240 mL)
   - Glass: 8 oz (240 mL)
   - Bowl: 6 oz (180 mL)
   - Carton: 8 oz (240 mL)
2. Estimate amount consumed
3. Calculate: Container size × % consumed
4. Example: 8 oz cup, 50% consumed = 4 oz (120 mL)
5. Record on I&O sheet

**Measuring Output:**
1. Put on gloves
2. Pour urine into graduated container
3. Place container on flat surface at eye level
4. Read amount at bottom of meniscus (curve)
5. Record amount on I&O sheet
6. Empty and rinse container
7. Remove gloves, perform hand hygiene

**Conversion:**
- 1 oz = 30 mL
- 8 oz = 240 mL
- 1 cup = 240 mL
- 1 liter = 1,000 mL

**Documentation:**
- Record intake and output each shift
- Total at end of shift
- Report significant imbalances to nurse

**Fluid Balance:**
- Intake should approximately equal output
- Report if output significantly less than intake (fluid retention)
- Report if output significantly more than intake (dehydration)

### Encouraging Nutrition and Hydration

**Strategies:**
1. Offer small, frequent meals
2. Provide favorite foods when possible
3. Make meals social and pleasant
4. Ensure comfortable position
5. Provide adequate time
6. Offer fluids frequently
7. Keep water pitcher filled and within reach
8. Provide oral care before meals
9. Reduce distractions (turn off TV)
10. Honor food preferences and cultural practices
11. Offer nutritional supplements if ordered
12. Report poor intake to nurse
