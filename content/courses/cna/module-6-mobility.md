## Lesson 6.1: Body Mechanics and Safe Transfers

### Principles of Body Mechanics

**Why Body Mechanics Matter:**
- Prevent back injuries (leading cause of CNA injury)
- Protect patients from falls and injuries
- Conserve energy
- Increase efficiency

**Key Principles:**

1. **Wide Base of Support**
   - Feet shoulder-width apart
   - One foot slightly ahead of the other
   - Provides stability

2. **Bend at Knees, Not Waist**
   - Keep back straight
   - Use leg muscles (stronger than back)
   - Squat down, don't bend over

3. **Hold Objects Close**
   - Reduces strain on back
   - Increases control
   - Easier to lift

4. **Use Leg Muscles**
   - Legs are stronger than back
   - Push up with legs
   - Avoid lifting with back

5. **Turn with Feet**
   - Don't twist at waist
   - Pivot with feet
   - Move whole body as unit

6. **Push Rather Than Pull**
   - Easier on body
   - More control
   - Safer for patient

7. **Get Help When Needed**
   - Two-person transfers for heavy patients
   - Use mechanical lifts
   - Never risk injury

### Transfer Belt (Gait Belt)

**Purpose:**
- Provides secure grip during transfers
- Reduces risk of falls
- Protects patient's arms and shoulders

**Proper Use:**

**Applying Transfer Belt:**
1. Explain procedure to patient
2. Position patient sitting on edge of bed
3. Place belt around patient's waist over clothing
4. Thread belt through buckle
5. Tighten snugly (should fit 2 fingers between belt and patient)
6. Buckle should be in front, slightly off-center
7. Check that belt is secure

**Grasping Transfer Belt:**
- Grasp from underneath with palms up
- Use overhand grip for more control
- Keep hands near patient's center of gravity
- Never grasp belt from top (can slip)

**When NOT to Use Transfer Belt:**
- Recent abdominal surgery
- Colostomy or feeding tube
- Fractured ribs
- Severe respiratory problems
- Pregnancy

### Bed to Chair Transfer

**Preparation:**
1. Check physician orders (weight-bearing status)
2. Gather equipment (wheelchair, transfer belt, non-skid footwear)
3. Explain procedure
4. Provide privacy
5. Lock bed wheels
6. Raise bed to comfortable working height
7. Lower side rail on working side

**Procedure:**

**Step 1: Position Wheelchair**
- Place wheelchair at 45-degree angle to bed
- On patient's stronger side
- Lock wheelchair wheels
- Remove or swing away footrests
- Raise armrest on side closest to bed (if removable)

**Step 2: Prepare Patient**
- Help patient sit on edge of bed (dangling)
- Allow patient to sit for 1-2 minutes (prevent dizziness)
- Put non-skid footwear on patient
- Apply transfer belt

**Step 3: Stand and Pivot**
- Stand facing patient
- Place your feet shoulder-width apart
- Patient's feet flat on floor, shoulder-width apart
- Grasp transfer belt from underneath
- Brace patient's weak knee with your knee
- On count of three, help patient stand
- Patient pushes off bed with hands
- Allow patient to stand for moment (check for dizziness)
- Pivot patient toward wheelchair
- Patient reaches for wheelchair armrests

**Step 4: Sit in Wheelchair**
- Help patient lower into wheelchair slowly
- Patient bends at hips and knees
- Guide patient into seated position
- Ensure patient is seated all the way back
- Position feet on footrests
- Remove transfer belt
- Cover lap with blanket if desired

**Step 5: Complete Transfer**
- Ensure patient is comfortable and safe
- Place call light within reach
- Lower bed
- Perform hand hygiene
- Document transfer

### Chair to Bed Transfer

**Reverse the process:**
1. Position wheelchair at 45-degree angle to bed
2. Lock wheels, remove footrests
3. Apply transfer belt
4. Help patient stand
5. Pivot toward bed
6. Help patient sit on edge of bed
7. Help patient lie down
8. Position comfortably
9. Remove transfer belt
10. Raise side rails if needed

### Mechanical Lift Transfer

**Types of Lifts:**

- Facility policy requires it

**Hoyer Lift Procedure:**

**Preparation:**
1. Get help (always 2-person procedure)
2. Gather equipment (lift, sling, wheelchair)
3. Explain procedure
4. Provide privacy

**Applying Sling:**
1. Roll patient to side
2. Place sling behind patient (bottom edge at knees)
3. Roll patient to other side
4. Pull sling through
5. Center sling under patient
6. Roll patient onto back
7. Smooth out wrinkles

**Using Lift:**
1. Position lift over bed
2. Lock lift wheels
3. Attach sling to lift hooks (follow color coding)
4. Ensure all hooks are secure
5. Cross patient's arms over chest
6. Slowly raise lift using hand crank or electric control
7. Lift patient just high enough to clear bed
8. Unlock lift wheels
9. Move lift away from bed
10. Position over wheelchair
11. Lock lift wheels
12. Slowly lower patient into wheelchair
13. Unhook sling (may leave under patient for next transfer)
