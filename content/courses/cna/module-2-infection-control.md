## Lesson 2.1: Infection Control Basics

### Learning Objectives
- Explain the chain of infection and how to break it
- Identify types of infections and transmission methods
- Describe standard precautions and transmission-based precautions
- Demonstrate proper hand hygiene technique

### The Chain of Infection

Infection requires six elements. Break any link to prevent infection:

1. **Infectious Agent** (pathogen)
   - Bacteria (MRSA, C. diff, E. coli)
   - Viruses (flu, COVID-19, norovirus)
   - Fungi (yeast infections, ringworm)
   - Parasites (scabies, lice)

2. **Reservoir** (where pathogen lives)
   - Humans (patients, staff, visitors)
   - Environment (surfaces, equipment, linens)
   - Food and water

3. **Portal of Exit** (how pathogen leaves reservoir)
   - Respiratory tract (coughing, sneezing)
   - Gastrointestinal tract (feces, vomit)
   - Urinary tract (urine)
   - Blood (cuts, needlesticks)
   - Skin (wounds, rashes)

4. **Mode of Transmission** (how pathogen travels)
   - **Contact** - Direct touch or indirect via contaminated objects
   - **Droplet** - Large droplets from coughing/sneezing (travel <6 feet)
   - **Airborne** - Small particles that stay suspended in air (travel >6 feet)
   - **Vector** - Insects or animals carry pathogen

5. **Portal of Entry** (how pathogen enters new host)
   - Same as portal of exit
   - Broken skin, mucous membranes, respiratory tract, etc.

6. **Susceptible Host** (person who can get infected)
   - Elderly
   - Very young
   - Immunocompromised
   - Chronic illness
   - Poor nutrition
   - Stress

### Breaking the Chain

**As a CNA, you break the chain by:**
- ✅ Hand hygiene (most important!)
- ✅ Using PPE correctly
- ✅ Cleaning and disinfecting equipment
- ✅ Proper waste disposal
- ✅ Following isolation precautions
- ✅ Covering coughs and sneezes
- ✅ Staying home when sick

### Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs)

Common HAIs you'll encounter:

#### MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus)
- Antibiotic-resistant bacteria
- Causes skin infections, pneumonia, bloodstream infections
- Spread by contact
- **Prevention:** Hand hygiene, contact precautions, clean equipment

#### C. difficile (Clostridioides difficile)
- Causes severe diarrhea and colitis
- Spread by contact with feces
- Spores survive on surfaces for months
- **Prevention:** Soap and water handwashing (alcohol doesn't kill spores), contact precautions

#### Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs)
- Often from catheters
- **Prevention:** Proper catheter care, remove catheters ASAP, perineal hygiene

#### Pneumonia
- Lung infection
- Can be from aspiration (food/liquid in lungs)
- **Prevention:** Elevate head of bed during meals, oral care, encourage coughing/deep breathing

#### Bloodstream Infections
- Often from IV lines
- **Prevention:** Proper IV site care (performed by nurses)

### Standard Precautions

Use with **ALL patients, ALL the time**, regardless of diagnosis:

1. **Hand Hygiene**
   - Before and after patient contact
   - Before clean/aseptic procedures
   - After body fluid exposure
   - After touching patient surroundings

2. **PPE**
   - Gloves for contact with blood, body fluids, mucous membranes, broken skin
   - Gown if clothing may be soiled
   - Mask and eye protection if splashing possible

3. **Respiratory Hygiene**
   - Cover coughs and sneezes
   - Provide tissues and masks to patients with respiratory symptoms
   - Perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions

4. **Safe Injection Practices**
   - (Not typically performed by CNAs, but be aware)

5. **Safe Handling of Contaminated Equipment**
   - Clean and disinfect between patients
   - Dispose of single-use items properly

6. **Environmental Cleaning**
   - Clean and disinfect surfaces regularly
   - Clean spills immediately

### Transmission-Based Precautions

Used **in addition to** standard precautions for specific infections:

#### Contact Precautions
**Used for:** MRSA, C. diff, scabies, lice, draining wounds

**Requirements:**
- Private room or cohort with same infection
- Gloves and gown for all patient contact
- Dedicated equipment (blood pressure cuff, stethoscope, thermometer)
- Remove PPE before leaving room
- Hand hygiene after removing PPE

**Sign on door:** "Contact Precautions"

#### Droplet Precautions
**Used for:** Flu, COVID-19, pertussis, meningitis, strep throat

**Requirements:**
- Private room or cohort
- Surgical mask within 6 feet of patient
- Patient wears mask during transport
- Limit patient movement outside room

**Sign on door:** "Droplet Precautions"

#### Airborne Precautions
**Used for:** Tuberculosis (TB), measles, chickenpox

**Requirements:**
- Negative pressure room (air flows into room, not out)
- N95 respirator (must be fit-tested)
- Keep door closed
- Limit patient movement; patient wears surgical mask during transport

**Sign on door:** "Airborne Precautions"

### Hand Hygiene

**Most important infection control measure!**

#### When to Perform Hand Hygiene
- Before patient contact
- Before clean/aseptic procedure
- After body fluid exposure risk
- After patient contact
- After touching patient surroundings
- Before eating
- After using restroom
- When hands are visibly soiled

#### Alcohol-Based Hand Rub (ABHR)
**Use when hands are not visibly soiled**

1. Apply product to palm of one hand
2. Rub hands together, covering all surfaces
3. Rub until hands are dry (15-20 seconds)

**Advantages:** Quick, effective, less drying than soap

#### Soap and Water
**Use when:**
- Hands are visibly soiled
- After caring for C. diff patients (alcohol doesn't kill spores)
- After using restroom
- Before eating

**Proper technique:**
1. Wet hands with warm water
2. Apply soap
3. Lather and scrub all surfaces for 15-20 seconds
   - Palms, backs of hands, between fingers, under nails, wrists
4. Rinse thoroughly
5. Dry with paper towel
6. Use paper towel to turn off faucet

### Key Takeaways
- Breaking any link in the chain of infection prevents disease spread
- Standard precautions are used with all patients
- Transmission-based precautions add extra protection for specific infections
- Hand hygiene is the single most important infection control measure

- Provide assistance with ambulation
- Use bed alarms for high-risk patients
- Ensure eyeglasses and hearing aids are in place

**Communication:**
- Remind patients to call for help before getting up
- Explain use of call light
- Orient confused patients to surroundings
- Report changes in patient condition

#### If a Patient Falls

**DO:**
1. Stay with patient, call for help
2. Check for injuries (bleeding, pain, deformity)
3. Do not move patient until assessed by nurse
4. Take vital signs
5. Provide comfort and reassurance
6. Complete incident report

**DON'T:**
- Leave patient alone
- Try to lift patient by yourself
- Blame patient for falling
- Fail to report the fall

### Restraints

**Restraints should be a LAST RESORT.**

#### Types of Restraints

### Body Mechanics

**Proper body mechanics prevent back injuries.**

#### Principles of Body Mechanics
1. **Wide base of support** - Feet shoulder-width apart
2. **Bend at knees, not waist** - Keep back straight
3. **Hold objects close to body** - Reduces strain
4. **Use leg muscles** - Legs are stronger than back
5. **Turn with feet, not waist** - Avoid twisting
6. **Push rather than pull** - Easier and safer
7. **Get help for heavy loads** - Don't try to be a hero

#### Safe Patient Transfers
- Assess patient's ability to help
- Explain what you're going to do
- Use transfer belt (gait belt)
- Get help if needed
- Use mechanical lifts for dependent patients
- Never lift under armpits (can cause injury)

**Transfer belt placement:**
- Place around patient's waist over clothing
- Ensure it's snug but not tight
- Grasp belt from underneath with palms up
- Stand close to patient

### Emergency Procedures

#### Cardiac Arrest
**Signs:** Unresponsive, not breathing or gasping, no pulse

**Action:**
1. Call for help immediately (code blue)
2. Start CPR if trained and facility policy allows
3. Get AED if available
4. Continue until help arrives

**Note:** Some facilities have CNAs perform CPR, others do not. Know your facility policy.

#### Choking
**Signs:** Clutching throat, unable to speak or cough, turning blue

**Action:**
1. Ask "Are you choking?"
2. If yes and they can't cough, perform Heimlich maneuver (if trained)
3. Call for help
4. Continue until object is dislodged or person becomes unconscious

**Heimlich maneuver:**
- Stand behind person
- Make fist, place above navel
- Grasp fist with other hand
- Give quick upward thrusts

#### Seizure
**Signs:** Sudden loss of consciousness, jerking movements, loss of bladder control

**Action:**
1. Call for help
2. Protect from injury (move furniture away, cushion head)
3. Turn on side if possible (prevents aspiration)
4. Do NOT restrain or put anything in mouth
5. Time the seizure
6. Stay with patient until fully alert
7. Report to nurse

#### Severe Bleeding
**Action:**
1. Call for help
2. Apply direct pressure with clean cloth
3. Elevate injured area above heart if possible
