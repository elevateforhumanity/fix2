## Case Studies

**Case Study 1:**
Mrs. Anderson has Alzheimer's disease. Every afternoon around 4pm, she becomes agitated and insists she needs to go home to cook dinner for her children (who are now adults). What should you do?

**Answer:** This is sundowning. Use validation and redirection. Don't argue that her children are grown. Instead, say "Tell me about your children. What did you like to cook?" Provide a snack, turn on lights, engage in calm activity. Maintain routine and ensure adequate lighting before dark.

**Case Study 2:**
Mr. Chen keeps asking "When is my wife coming?" every 5 minutes, even though you've told him she visits on Saturdays. What should you do?

**Answer:** This is repetitive questioning due to memory loss. Answer patiently each time. Don't say "I already told you." Consider writing "Wife visits Saturday" on a note card. Look for underlying anxiety - he may need reassurance. Redirect with an activity or reminisce about his wife.
