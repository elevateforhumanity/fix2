## Lesson 3.1: Measuring Vital Signs

### Learning Objectives
- Measure temperature, pulse, respiration, and blood pressure accurately
- Identify normal and abnormal vital sign ranges
- Recognize factors that affect vital signs
- Document vital signs correctly

### The Four Vital Signs

Vital signs are measurements of the body's basic functions. Changes in vital signs can indicate illness or medical emergencies.

#### 1. Temperature

**Normal Range:** 97.6°F - 99.6°F (36.4°C - 37.6°C)

**Methods:**
- **Oral** - Most common, under tongue (98.6°F average)
- **Axillary** - Under armpit (97.6°F average, least accurate)
- **Tympanic** - In ear canal (98.6°F average)
- **Temporal** - Across forehead (98.6°F average)
- **Rectal** - Most accurate (99.6°F average, rarely used in adults)

**When NOT to take oral temperature:**
- Patient is unconscious or confused
- Patient has mouth injuries
- Patient is on oxygen
- Patient recently ate, drank, or smoked (wait 15 minutes)
- Patient is infant or young child

**Procedure - Oral Temperature (Digital Thermometer):**
1. Perform hand hygiene, gather supplies
2. Explain procedure to patient
3. Put on gloves
4. Place disposable cover on thermometer
5. Ask patient to open mouth
6. Place thermometer under tongue, to one side
7. Ask patient to close lips (not bite down)
8. Leave in place until thermometer beeps
9. Remove thermometer, read display
10. Remove and discard cover
11. Record temperature
12. Clean thermometer per facility policy
13. Remove gloves, perform hand hygiene

**Fever Classifications:**
- Low-grade: 99.6°F - 100.9°F
- Moderate: 101°F - 102.9°F
- High: 103°F - 104.9°F
- Dangerous: 105°F and above (medical emergency)

**Hypothermia:** Below 95°F (medical emergency)

#### 2. Pulse

**Normal Range:** 60-100 beats per minute (adults)

**Common Pulse Sites:**
- **Radial** - Wrist (most common)
- **Brachial** - Inside elbow
- **Carotid** - Neck (use during CPR)
- **Femoral** - Groin
- **Apical** - Chest (heart rate, most accurate)

**Pulse Characteristics:**
- **Rate** - Beats per minute
- **Rhythm** - Regular or irregular
- **Strength** - Strong, weak, or bounding

**Procedure - Radial Pulse:**
1. Perform hand hygiene
2. Explain procedure to patient
3. Position patient comfortably (sitting or lying)
4. Locate radial artery on thumb side of wrist
5. Place first two fingers on artery (don't use thumb)
6. Press gently until you feel pulse
7. Count beats for 60 seconds (or 30 seconds and multiply by 2)
8. Note rhythm and strength
9. Record pulse rate, rhythm, and strength
10. Perform hand hygiene

**Procedure - Apical Pulse:**
1. Perform hand hygiene, gather stethoscope
2. Explain procedure, provide privacy
3. Expose left chest area
4. Warm stethoscope in hands
5. Place stethoscope at apex of heart (5th intercostal space, left midclavicular line)
6. Count heartbeats for 60 seconds
7. Cover patient
8. Record apical pulse
9. Clean stethoscope with alcohol wipe
10. Perform hand hygiene

**Abnormal Findings:**
- **Tachycardia** - Pulse over 100 bpm
- **Bradycardia** - Pulse under 60 bpm
- **Irregular rhythm** - Skipped beats or uneven pattern
- **Weak/thready pulse** - Difficult to feel
- **Bounding pulse** - Very strong, forceful

**Report immediately:** Pulse below 60 or above 100, irregular rhythm, very weak or very strong pulse

#### 3. Respiration

**Normal Range:** 12-20 breaths per minute (adults)

**Characteristics:**
- **Rate** - Breaths per minute
- **Rhythm** - Regular or irregular
- **Depth** - Shallow, normal, or deep
- **Sound** - Quiet, noisy, wheezing, gurgling

**Procedure - Counting Respirations:**
1. Keep fingers on patient's wrist (as if taking pulse)
2. Don't tell patient you're counting respirations (they may breathe differently)
3. Watch chest rise and fall
4. Count one rise and one fall as one respiration
5. Count for 60 seconds (or 30 seconds and multiply by 2)
6. Note rate, rhythm, depth, and sound
7. Record respirations
8. Perform hand hygiene

**Abnormal Findings:**
- **Tachypnea** - Rapid breathing (over 20 breaths/min)
- **Bradypnea** - Slow breathing (under 12 breaths/min)
- **Dyspnea** - Difficulty breathing, shortness of breath
- **Apnea** - Absence of breathing
- **Cheyne-Stokes** - Periods of deep breathing alternating with apnea
- **Wheezing** - High-pitched whistling sound
- **Rales/crackles** - Wet, crackling sounds
- **Stridor** - Harsh, high-pitched sound on inspiration

**Report immediately:** Respirations below 12 or above 20, irregular pattern, difficulty breathing, abnormal sounds

#### 4. Blood Pressure

**Normal Range:** 
- Systolic: 90-120 mmHg
- Diastolic: 60-80 mmHg
- Written as: 120/80 (systolic/diastolic)

**Blood Pressure Categories:**
- **Normal:** Less than 120/80
- **Elevated:** 120-129/less than 80
- **Stage 1 Hypertension:** 130-139/80-89
- **Stage 2 Hypertension:** 140 or higher/90 or higher
- **Hypertensive Crisis:** Higher than 180/120 (medical emergency)

15. Continue releasing air
16. Listen for last sound (diastolic pressure)
17. Quickly release remaining air

- **Q**uality - Sharp, dull, burning, aching?
- **R**adiates - Does it spread to other areas?
- **S**everity - Rate 0-10
- **T**iming - When did it start? Constant or intermittent?

**Procedure - Pain Assessment:**
1. Ask patient if they have pain
2. Ask them to rate pain 0-10
3. Ask about location
4. Ask about quality (sharp, dull, etc.)
5. Ask what makes it better or worse
6. Ask when it started
7. Document all information
8. Report to nurse

**Non-verbal Pain Signs:**
