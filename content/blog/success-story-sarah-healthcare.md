# Single Mom to Healthcare Professional

Sarah was working two minimum-wage jobs to support her three kids. Today, she's a certified medical assistant earning $22/hour with benefits.

## The Challenge

"I couldn't afford to quit working to go back to school," Sarah explains. Our flexible evening program made it possible.

## The Transformation

- 12-week medical assistant program
- Studied while kids were in school
- Clinical rotation at local hospital
- Job offer before graduation

## Life Now

"I have one job, health insurance, and time with my kids. That's everything."
