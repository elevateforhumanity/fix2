# From Incarceration to Business Owner

Marcus came to us through the Justice Reinvestment Initiative after serving 8 years. Today, he owns "Marcus's Cuts," a thriving barbershop in Indianapolis.

## The Journey

"I always cut hair in prison," Marcus shares. "But I never thought I could make it a real career."

Through our barber apprenticeship program, Marcus:
- Completed 1,500 hours of training
- Passed his state board exam
- Built a client base
- Saved to open his own shop

## Impact

Marcus now employs 3 other barbers and mentors young men in his community. "Elevate gave me more than skills—they gave me hope."
