# Balancing Work and Training

Many students work while training. Here's how to manage it all.

## Strategy 1: Choose Flexible Programs

Evening, weekend, or online options accommodate work schedules.

## Strategy 2: Communicate with Employer

Many employers support training. Ask about flexible scheduling.

## Strategy 3: Use Time Wisely

- Study during lunch breaks
- Use commute time for audio learning
- Wake up 30 minutes earlier

## Strategy 4: Batch Tasks

Group similar activities to maximize efficiency.

## Strategy 5: Ask for Help

Family, friends, childcare—accept support.

## Strategy 6: Prioritize Ruthlessly

Some things can wait. Training is temporary.

## Strategy 7: Take Care of Yourself

Sleep, nutrition, exercise—don't sacrifice health.

## Strategy 8: Stay Focused on Goals

Remember why you're doing this. The sacrifice is temporary.
