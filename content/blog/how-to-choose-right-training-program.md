# Choosing the Right Training Program

Not all training programs are equal. Here's how to choose wisely.

## Factor 1: Job Demand

Research local job openings. Choose fields with strong demand.

## Factor 2: Earning Potential

Consider starting salary and growth potential. Balance passion with practicality.

## Factor 3: Program Length

Can you commit to the timeline? Shorter isn't always better.

## Factor 4: Certification/Licensure

Does the program lead to recognized credentials?

## Factor 5: Job Placement

What's the program's placement rate? Do they help with job search?

## Red Flags

- No accreditation
