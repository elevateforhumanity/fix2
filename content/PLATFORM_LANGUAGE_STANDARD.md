# ELEVATE FOR HUMANITY PLATFORM

**Student-First Experience, System-Enforced Quality**

---

## WELCOME — START HERE

This platform is built to help you move forward without confusion.

You can use it to:

- Explore training and job programs
- Apply and submit required information
- Track your progress
- Know exactly what to do next

**If a page appears on this site, it is ready to use now.**
There are no unfinished or "coming soon" pages.

---

## HOW THIS PLATFORM IS ORGANIZED (PLAIN LANGUAGE)

Every page on this platform follows a **page type**.

A page type makes sure every page includes:

- A clear title
- A short explanation of what the page is for
- Clear actions you can take
- A clear next step

This keeps the site consistent and easy to understand, no matter where you are.

---

## WHAT A "PAGE TYPE" MEANS FOR YOU

You don't need to know technical terms.

What matters is this:

**Every page must clearly answer:**

1. Who this page is for
2. What you can do here
3. What happens next

If a page doesn't do all three, it is not allowed to be live.

---

## WHAT YOU WILL NEVER SEE (ON PURPOSE)

You will never see:

- "Coming soon"
- "Check back later"
- "Under construction"
- Empty pages
- Pages that don't explain what to do

**If something is locked or unavailable, the page will explain:**

- Why it's locked
- What you need to do to unlock it
- Who can help if you have questions

---

## YOUR DASHBOARD (IMPORTANT)

Your dashboard shows your real information.

That means:

- Only you (and approved staff) can see it
- No one can access it just by typing a link
- No fake numbers or demo data

**If your dashboard is empty, it will explain:**

- Why it's empty
- What action creates information
- What you should do next

---

## STUDENT GUARANTEE

Every page must be:

- Complete
- Honest
- Easy to understand
- Ready to use today

**If something feels confusing, that's not your fault — it's something we fix.**

---

## HOW TO USE THIS PLATFORM (STEP-BY-STEP)

### STEP 1: START WITH A PROGRAM PAGE

Program pages explain:

- Who the program is for
- What you need to qualify
- What you receive when finished

If you qualify, you'll see a clear button to apply.

### STEP 2: APPLY AND SUBMIT INFORMATION

When you apply:

- Complete each section carefully
- Upload required documents
- Submit when finished

You'll see confirmation that your application was received.

### STEP 3: CHECK YOUR DASHBOARD

Your dashboard shows:

- Application status
- Required next steps
- Messages from staff
- Deadlines (if any)

If something is required, it will be clearly labeled.

### STEP 4: COMPLETE TASKS AS THEY APPEAR

Tasks appear only when they apply to you.

Each task explains:

- What you need to do
- Why it's required
- What happens after you complete it

### STEP 5: GET HELP WHEN YOU NEED IT

If you're unsure:

- Use the contact or support option on the page
- Ask questions early — support is here for that

**You are never expected to guess.**

## TOOLTIP & MICROCOPY STANDARDS

_(Used across forms, dashboards, and actions)_

### Why do I see this?

> This section shows what's required for your next step.

### Why is this empty?

> This will update after you complete the step listed above.

### What happens if I submit this?

> Your information is saved and reviewed by staff. You'll see updates here.

### Why can't I access this yet?

> This step unlocks after you complete the requirements shown on this page.

### Who can see this?

> Only you and authorized staff working with your program.

**Every tooltip must explain cause → action → result.**

---

## ACCESSIBILITY PROMISE

This platform is designed to be:

- Easy to read
- Keyboard and screen-reader friendly
- Clear even if English is not your first language

**If something is hard to understand, that feedback helps improve the system.**

---

## SYSTEM QUALITY GUARANTEE (INTERNAL BUT HONEST)

Behind the scenes:

- Every page follows an approved page type
- Pages cannot go live without complete content
- Generic or misleading language is blocked automatically
- Dashboards are protected by secure login and role rules
- Incomplete pages cannot be published

**Quality is enforced by the system, not by promises.**

---

## ONE SENTENCE THAT APPLIES EVERYWHERE

> **"If a page appears on this platform, it is complete, accurate, and ready to use."**

That statement is enforced — not just stated.

---

## WHY THIS MATTERS

This approach:

- ✅ Protects students from confusion
- ✅ Protects staff from rework
- ✅ Protects funders from misrepresentation
- ✅ Protects the platform from rushed or fake completion

**Most importantly, it respects the student's time and trust.**

---

## IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES

### For Developers

**Every page component must:**

1. Declare its archetype explicitly
2. Include all required sections per archetype
3. Use approved language patterns from this document
4. Pass automated quality checks before deployment

**Forbidden patterns:**

- Ad-hoc layout or copy outside archetype system
- Future-tense promises ("will be added", "coming soon")
- Vague marketing language without operational meaning
- Empty states without explanation
- Generic CTAs without specific outcomes

### For Content Writers

**All copy must:**

1. Answer: Who is this for? What can they do? What happens next?
2. Use active voice and direct language
3. Explain cause → action → result
4. Avoid jargon and technical terms
5. Be truthful to current system behavior

**Test every sentence:**

- Can a non-technical student understand it?
- Does it explain what to do, not just what exists?
- Is it honest about what's available now?

### For Designers

**All interfaces must:**

1. Follow archetype structure requirements
2. Include clear next-step CTAs
3. Provide tooltips for non-obvious elements
4. Show empty states with explanations
5. Be keyboard and screen-reader accessible

**Visual hierarchy:**

- Title (what this is)
- Purpose (why you're here)
- Content (what you need to know)
- Action (what to do next)

---

## QUALITY ENFORCEMENT

### Automated Checks

**Build fails if:**

- Page doesn't map to an archetype
- Forbidden phrases detected
- Metadata missing or duplicated
- Protected routes lack server auth
- Required sections missing

**Run checks:**

```bash
npm run archetype:check
npm run spot-check
npm run ci:check
```

### Manual Review Checklist

**Before approving any page:**

- [ ] Can you answer: Who is this for?
- [ ] Can you answer: What can they do here?
- [ ] Can you answer: What happens next?
- [ ] Are empty states explained?
- [ ] Are CTAs specific and actionable?
- [ ] Is all content truthful to current behavior?
- [ ] Does it pass accessibility standards?
