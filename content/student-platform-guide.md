# Welcome — Start Here

This platform is here to help you move forward — step by step.

You can use it to:

- Explore training and job programs
- Apply and track your progress
- Upload documents and complete requirements
- See exactly what to do next

**If you can see a page, it means it is ready to use now.**

There are no unfinished pages.

## How This Site Is Organized (Simple)

Every page on this site follows a **page type**.

A page type makes sure every page includes:

- A clear title
- A short explanation of what the page is for
- Clear actions you can take
- A next step so you're never stuck

This keeps things consistent and easy to understand.

---

## What a "Page Type" Means for You

You don't need to remember the word "archetype."

What matters is this:

**Every page must explain:**

1. Who it's for
2. What you can do here
3. What happens next

If a page doesn't do that, it is not allowed to be live.

---

## What You Will NOT See (On Purpose)

You will never see:

- "Coming soon"
- "Check back later"
- "Under construction"
- Empty pages
- Pages that don't explain what to do

**If something is locked or unavailable, the page will tell you:**

- Why it's locked
- What you need to do to unlock it
- Who can help if you have questions

---

## Your Dashboard (Important)

Your dashboard shows your real progress.

This means:

- Only you (and approved staff) can see it
- No one can access it just by guessing a link
- No fake numbers or demo information

**If something is missing, the dashboard will explain:**

- Why it's missing
- What step creates that information
- What you should do next

---

## Student Guarantee (This Matters)

Every page must be:

- Complete
- Honest
- Easy to understand
- Ready to use today

**If something looks confusing, it's not your fault — it's something we fix.**

## How to Use This Platform

### Step 1: Start With the Program Page

Read the program page carefully. It tells you:

- Who the program is for
- What you need to qualify
- What you'll receive when finished

If you qualify, you'll see a clear button to apply.

### Step 2: Apply and Submit Information

When you apply:

- Fill out each section completely
- Upload any required documents
- Submit when finished

You'll see a confirmation when your application is received.

### Step 3: Check Your Dashboard

Your dashboard shows:

- Application status
- Required next steps
- Messages from staff
- Deadlines (if any)

If something is required, it will be clearly labeled.

### Step 4: Complete Tasks as They Appear

Tasks appear only when they apply to you.

Each task explains:

- What you need to do
- Why it's required
- When it's due

### Step 5: Reach Out If You Need Help

If you're unsure:

- Use the contact or support option on the page
- Ask questions early — that's what support is for

**You are never expected to guess.**

## Accessibility Promise

This site is designed to be:

- Easy to read
- Keyboard and screen-reader friendly
- Clear even if English is not your first language

**If something is hard to understand, that's feedback — not failure.**

---

## One Sentence You Can Put Everywhere (Student-Safe)

> **"If a page appears on this platform, it is complete, accurate, and ready to use."**

That's not a promise — it's enforced by the system.
