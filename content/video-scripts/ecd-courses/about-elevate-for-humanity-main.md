# About Elevate for Humanity & Elevate Connects Directory – AI Homepage Narrator (~90 seconds)

Welcome to Elevate Connects Directory, powered by Elevate for Humanity.

This platform exists to connect you with high-demand training programs, workforce partners, and real job opportunities — with a special focus on federal and state funding so cost is not the reason you stay stuck.

Elevate for Humanity collaborates with WIOA, Workforce Ready Grants, Job Ready Indy, registered apprenticeships, and other workforce initiatives. That means many programs listed here may be available at low or no cost to eligible learners, including youth, adults, and returning citizens.

When you explore this directory, you'll find pathways in skilled trades, healthcare, transportation, technology, beauty, and more. Each program listing is designed to answer three questions:

• What skills will I learn?  
• What careers can this training lead to?  
• What funding or support might help me pay for it?

When you click into a program, you can request more information or apply. From there, our team and partners can help you review eligibility for federal and state workforce funding, match you to the right class or apprenticeship, and support you through enrollment.

Our goal is not just to list classes. Our goal is to help you move from interest to enrollment to employment — with real credentials, real skills, and real opportunities.

Start by exploring the programs on ElevateConnectsDirectory.org, choose a pathway that aligns with your goals, and submit your interest form. We're excited to help you elevate what's possible for your future.
