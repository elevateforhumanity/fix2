# Delegate / Instructor Portal (30–45 seconds)
**Title:** For Instructors & Delegates

If you teach, coach, or support learners, this part is for you.  

Inside the **Delegate Portal**, you can view your students, mark attendance, upload grades, and leave notes for case managers—all from one place.  

No more chasing emails or sticky notes. Everyone on the team sees the same information, so students don't fall through the cracks.  

Log in, go to **"My Students"**, and start with today's roster.
