# Become a Licensed Barber Through Apprenticeship

**Length:** ~45 seconds

In this apprenticeship you'll train in a real barbershop environment, work alongside a licensed mentor, and track the hours you need for licensure. You'll learn hair cutting, sanitation, customer service, and business fundamentals.

Thanks to our workforce funding partnerships, eligible candidates can apply at little to no cost and still earn while learning.
