# Launch Your CDL Truck Driving Career

**Length:** ~45 seconds

Looking for a career with freedom, good pay, and growth potential? Our CDL & Transportation Training program might be your entry point.

You'll train behind the wheel of big-rig trucks, learn safety regulations, master routing and logistics basics, and be ready for commercial driver opportunities. Partner employers are actively hiring drivers today.

Because we work with workforce funding mechanisms, eligible students can often access tuition support and job-placement assistance through state and federal programs like WIOA.

Head over to the CDL Programs page, check start dates and prerequisites, and apply to get moving toward your new career.
