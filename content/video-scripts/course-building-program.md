# Building Tech & Skilled Trades Pathway

**Length:** ~45 seconds

If you're hands-on, technically curious, and ready for a career that keeps you busy and valued, our Building Technician & Skilled Trades pathway is for you.

You'll learn maintenance, basic electrical, plumbing, controls, HVAC systems, and more — skills needed in apartments, schools, hospitals, and commercial buildings.

Our workforce-funded model means eligible students may receive full or partial tuition support via state or federal grants. We also connect you to employer networks for placements once you complete training.
