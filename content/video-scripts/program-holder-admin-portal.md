# Program Holder / Admin Portal (30–45 seconds)

**Title:** Program Holder Dashboard Overview

Welcome to the **Program Holder Portal** inside Elevate Connects Directory.

Here you can manage **program listings, cohorts, attendance, and outcomes** in one secure place.

Update your schedules, track student progress, upload documents, and view who's funded under **WorkOne, WRG, WIOA, or local grants**.

Our goal is to make your job easier—less spreadsheets, more real-time data and compliance-ready reporting.

When you're logged in, start by checking your **current cohorts** and adding any upcoming classes or seats.
