# Elevate for Humanity – Video Scripts

This folder contains **ready-to-use video scripts** for AI avatars, voiceovers, or live recording.

Each `.md` file corresponds to a section/page on https://elevateforhumanity.org, for use as placeholders or final content.

You can:
- Paste these into tools like HeyGen / Synthesia / Pictory
- Use them for voiceover when recording real footage
- Update wording as programs and branding evolve
