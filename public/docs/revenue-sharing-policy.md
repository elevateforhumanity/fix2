**Version:** 1.0

## Overview

This document outlines the revenue sharing structure, payment terms, and billing policies for all Elevate for Humanity suboffice partners.

---

## Revenue Share Structure

### Standard Split: 40/60

- **Main office (Elevate for Humanity) receives:** 40% of base tax prep fee
- **Suboffice receives:** 60% of base tax prep fee

### What Main Office Provides

For the 40% share, main office provides:

- ✅ Drake Software licenses (unlimited)
- ✅ All training and onboarding
- ✅ Technical support 24/7
- ✅ Marketing materials
- ✅ Brand and reputation
- ✅ Compliance oversight
- ✅ Quality assurance
- ✅ All add-on fee processing

### Add-On Fees

**Main office receives 100% of all add-on fees:**

- Refund advance fees
- Prepaid card fees
- Bank product fees
- Upsell revenue
- Additional services

**Suboffice receives ONLY the 60% of base tax prep fee.**

### Revenue Calculation

```
Client pays: $300 for tax preparation
Add-on fees: $50 (refund advance fee)

Main office receives:
  - $300 × 40% = $120 (base fee share)
  - $50 × 100% = $50 (add-on fees)
  - Total: $170

Suboffice receives:
  - $300 × 60% = $180 (base fee share only)
  - Total: $180
```

### No Software Costs Deducted

Unlike other programs, you do NOT pay for:

- ❌ Software licensing (included in 40% share)
- ❌ Training costs (included)
- ❌ Support fees (included)
- ❌ Marketing materials (included)

**You receive 60% of every base tax prep fee. No deductions.**

---

## Payment Timing - CRITICAL

### IRS Payment Release Process

**YOU GET PAID ONLY AFTER IRS RELEASES CLIENT REFUNDS**

This is standard industry practice and protects both parties.

#### Payment Flow:

1. **Client files return** → Preparer completes and e-files
2. **IRS reviews** → Typically 1-3 days
3. **IRS accepts return** → Confirmation received
4. **IRS processes refund** → 7-21 days
5. **IRS releases refund** → Client receives money
6. **Payment to main office** → Within 2 business days
7. **Revenue share distributed** → Within 5 business days

#### Timeline Examples:

**E-file with Direct Deposit (Fastest):**

- Day 1: File return
- Day 2-3: IRS accepts
- Day 14-21: IRS releases refund
- Day 23-26: You receive payment
- **Total: 23-26 days**

**E-file with Paper Check:**

- Day 1: File return
- Day 2-3: IRS accepts
- Day 21-28: IRS releases refund
- Day 30-33: You receive payment
- **Total: 30-33 days**

**Paper File:**

- Day 1: Mail return
- Day 30-45: IRS processes
- Day 60-90: IRS releases refund
- Day 92-95: You receive payment
- **Total: 92-95 days**

### Delayed or Offset Refunds

If the IRS:

- Delays a refund for review
- Offsets a refund for back taxes/child support
- Rejects a return for errors

**Your payment for that specific client is delayed until resolved.**

This protects both parties from chargebacks and ensures compliance.
