[Scene 2 – Hybrid learning + hands-on visuals]
Every program is designed with hybrid learning in mind.
You can train online, practice hands-on, complete modules at your own pace, and still have full instructor support.
Whether you're a parent, working, or starting over—our system is built to fit your life.

[Scene 3 – Earn while you learn / apprenticeship]
Through our Registered Apprenticeship Programs you can earn while you learn.
Gain real work experience, build your hours, and step into a career path with confidence.
You're not just studying—you're working, growing, and getting paid to build your future.

[Scene 4 – JRI funding pathway]
Our partnership with JRI opens doors for justice-involved individuals to receive
training, certifications, and wrap-around support at no cost.
We believe everyone deserves a second chance and a clear path to employment.

[Scene 5 – WRG pathway]
With the Workforce Ready Grant (WRG), eligible students can complete high-demand certifications
—completely tuition-free.
WRG was designed to help you reskill fast and step into high-wage, high-opportunity careers.

[Scene 6 – WIOA pathway]
Through WIOA, students receive funding for training, case management, career coaching,
supportive services, and job placement assistance.
This makes your education more than a class—it becomes a career plan.
