NEW VERSION (Hero Banner):
At Elevate for Humanity, we believe becoming a barber should be more than just learning how to cut hair. It should lead to a real career. Our Barber Apprenticeship combines hands-on training, classroom instruction, and paid learning opportunities to help you earn while you learn. You'll build skills, gain experience in real shop environments, and work toward licensure with structured support every step of the way. If you're ready to turn your passion into a profession, this is your pathway. Welcome to Elevate for Humanity.

ORIGINAL VERSION:
[Scene 1 – Clean barbershop visuals | Slow pan | Soft upbeat music]
At Elevate for Humanity, you can become a licensed barber in months, not years.
This is a state-approved, WIOA-funded, apprenticeship-backed program designed to launch your career fast.

[Scene 2 – Students practicing fades, lineups, shaves]
You'll learn real barbering skills:
fades, tapers, line-ups, beard sculpting, razor work, sanitation, client consultations—
everything you need to feel confident behind the chair.

[Scene 3 – Classroom + hands-on training]
Training is hands-on, modern, and supported by a real school with real instructors.
You also get access to online training modules, practice tests, and step-by-step guidance so you can learn anywhere.

[Scene 4 – Apprenticeship highlight]
This program includes a Registered Barber Apprenticeship approved through DOL RAPIDS.
That means you can earn while you learn, build real hours, and graduate with experience—not just a certificate.

[Scene 5 – Funding options]
Most students qualify for free tuition through WorkOne and WIOA,
plus additional support through WRG, JRI, and apprenticeship pathways.
If you don't qualify, we offer Stripe Pay Now, Klarna, Affirm, and other flexible options.

[Scene 6 – Career outcome visuals]
Barbers make $45,000–$100,000+ per year,
and many go on to open their own shop, studio suite, or mobile grooming business.
Your license gives you freedom, income, and a skill no one can take away.

[Scene 7 – Final Call to Action]
