Hey there. I'm Elizabeth Greene, and I started Elevate For Humanity because I believe everyone deserves a real shot at a better life.

Maybe you've been turned down for jobs. Maybe you're working two jobs and still can't pay rent. Maybe you're coming home from incarceration and nobody will give you a chance.

I see you. Not your mistakes. Not your struggles. Your potential.

We offer free career training in barbering, healthcare, HVAC, and more. If you qualify for government funding, it costs you nothing. Zero debt. Real credentials. Real jobs waiting.

Don't qualify? No problem. We have payment plans that work.

This isn't charity. This is justice. This is what happens when someone actually believes in you.

Your past doesn't define your future. Let's build it together.
