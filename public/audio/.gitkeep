# Hero voiceover audio
# Replace with: hero-voiceover.mp3
# 
# This is a separate audio track that syncs with the hero video.
# The video plays muted, and the voiceover attempts to autoplay.
# If browser blocks audio autoplay, user sees "Tap to enable voiceover" button.
#
# Audio should match video duration (8-10 seconds).
