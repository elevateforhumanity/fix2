## Step 1: Supabase Migrations (YOU DO THIS - 15 min)

## Step 3: I'll Add to Netlify (I DO THIS - 5 min)

Once you provide the keys above, I'll:
1. Add them to Netlify environment variables
2. Trigger a redeploy
3. Test all functions

---

## Step 4: Test Everything (WE DO TOGETHER - 30 min)

I'll test each function and show you the results.

---

## Quick Start Option

**If you want to start with just the essentials:**

1. Run Supabase migrations (you)
2. Provide Stripe keys (you)
3. I add to Netlify (me)
4. Test payments (we test)

**Everything else can be added later!**

## What Do You Want to Do?

**Option A:** Give me all the keys now (full configuration)
**Option B:** Just Stripe for now (minimum viable)
**Option C:** Give me dashboard access (I'll get the keys)

**Which option?**
