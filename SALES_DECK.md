## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM YOU'RE SOLVING

**Workforce organizations face fragmented systems:**

❌ Generic LMS platforms don't handle workforce funding  
❌ Spreadsheets for apprenticeship tracking  
❌ Manual compliance reporting

❌ Custom builds cost $300K+ and take 18 months

**The result:**

- Delayed deployments
- Compliance risk
- High operational costs
- Limited scalability
