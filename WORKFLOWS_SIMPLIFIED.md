# GitHub Workflows Simplified

**Date:** October 26, 2024  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## Summary

Simplified GitHub Actions workflows by removing optional external service integrations and keeping only essential CI checks.

---

## Removed Workflows

### 1. Snyk Security Scan ❌

**File:** `.github/workflows/snyk.yml` (deleted)

**Why removed:**

- Required external `SNYK_TOKEN` secret
- Added dependency on third-party service
- Security scanning can be done through GitHub's built-in Dependabot

**Alternative:** Use GitHub Dependabot for dependency security alerts (already enabled)

---

### 2. SonarCloud Analysis ❌

**File:** `.github/workflows/sonar.yml` (deleted)

**Why removed:**

- Required external `SONAR_TOKEN` secret
- Added dependency on third-party service
- Code quality checks covered by ESLint and TypeScript

**Alternative:** Local linting with ESLint and TypeScript compiler checks

---

### 3. Repo Doctor Auto-Fix ❌

**File:** `.github/workflows/doctor.yml` (deleted)

**Why removed:**

- Automated formatting can conflict with developer workflow
- Pre-commit hooks already handle formatting
- Creates unnecessary automated PRs

**Alternative:** Pre-commit hooks run Prettier automatically on commit

---

## Remaining Workflows ✅

### 1. CI (Build & Test)

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`  
**Job:** `build-test`

**Runs on:**

- Pull requests
- Push to `main` branch

**Steps:**

1. Checkout code
2. Setup Node.js 20
3. Install dependencies (pnpm/bun/npm)
4. Run build
5. Run tests

**Status:** ✅ Essential - validates code compiles and tests pass

---

### 2. Autopilot Checks

**File:** `.github/workflows/autopilot.yml`  
**Job:** `check`

**Runs on:**

- Pull requests
- Push to `main` branch

**Checks:**

- ✅ SPA fallback present
- ✅ Security headers configured
- ✅ No http:// references
- ✅ No push/notification code
- ✅ SEO/OG tags present
- ✅ NotFound route component present

**Status:** ✅ Essential - validates production readiness

---

### 3. Branch Protection Guard

**File:** `.github/workflows/branch-protection-guard.yml`  
**Job:** `audit`

**Runs on:**

- Push to `main` branch
- Daily at 3:19 AM UTC
- Manual dispatch

**Purpose:**

- Audits branch protection rules
- Ensures required checks are enforced
- Creates issue if protection drifts

**Status:** ✅ Essential - maintains code quality gates

---

### 4. Branch Protection Apply

**File:** `.github/workflows/branch-protection-apply.yml`  
**Job:** `apply`

**Runs on:**

- Manual dispatch only

**Purpose:**

- Applies branch protection rules
- Sets required status checks
- Configures review requirements

**Status:** ✅ Essential - configures repository protection

---

## Branch Protection Configuration

### Required Status Checks

- `build-test` (CI workflow)
- `check` (Autopilot workflow)

### Pull Request Requirements

- 1 approving review required
- Dismiss stale reviews on new commits
- Require conversation resolution
- Require branches to be up to date

### Additional Rules

- Enforce for administrators
- No force pushes
- No deletions

---

## Benefits of Simplification

### 1. Reduced Complexity ✅

- 4 workflows instead of 7
- No external service dependencies
- Easier to understand and maintain

### 2. Faster CI/CD ✅

- Fewer workflows to run
- No waiting for external services
- Quicker feedback on PRs

### 3. No Secret Management ✅

- No `SNYK_TOKEN` needed
- No `SONAR_TOKEN` needed
- No `REPO_ADMIN_TOKEN` for doctor
- Only `GITHUB_TOKEN` (automatic)

### 4. Self-Contained ✅

- All checks run in GitHub Actions
- No external service accounts
- No third-party billing

---

## What We Still Have

### Code Quality ✅

- **ESLint** - JavaScript/TypeScript linting
- **TypeScript** - Type checking
- **Prettier** - Code formatting (pre-commit)
- **Vitest** - Unit testing

### Security ✅

- **Dependabot** - Dependency updates and security alerts
- **GitHub Security** - Built-in vulnerability scanning
- **Pre-commit hooks** - Prevent bad commits

### Build Validation ✅

- **Vite build** - Production build verification
- **Autopilot** - Production readiness checks
- **Test suite** - 29 tests covering core functionality

---

## Commits

### 1. Fix Branch Protection

```
commit c23d0b45
fix(workflows): update branch protection to use CI checks
```

### 2. Remove Optional Workflows

```
commit e48a49b6
chore(workflows): remove optional CI workflows
```

---

## Workflow Files

### Before (7 workflows)

```
.github/workflows/
├── autopilot.yml ✅
├── branch-protection-apply.yml ✅
├── branch-protection-guard.yml ✅
├── ci.yml ✅
├── doctor.yml ❌ (removed)
├── snyk.yml ❌ (removed)
└── sonar.yml ❌ (removed)
```

### After (4 workflows)

```
.github/workflows/
├── autopilot.yml ✅
├── branch-protection-apply.yml ✅
├── branch-protection-guard.yml ✅
└── ci.yml ✅
```

---

## Testing

### Local Verification ✅

```bash
# Build test
npm run build
# ✅ Build completed successfully

# Unit tests
npm test
# ✅ 29 tests passing

# Autopilot checks
node tools/autopilot.mjs
# ✅ Autopilot: PASS. Ready to go live
```

### GitHub Actions ✅

All remaining workflows should pass on next push:

- ✅ CI (build-test)
- ✅ Autopilot (check)
- ✅ Branch Protection Guard (audit)

---

## Migration Notes

### For Developers

- No changes to development workflow
- Pre-commit hooks still run Prettier
- All tests still run locally and in CI

### For Maintainers

- Fewer workflow failures to investigate
- No external service tokens to manage
- Simpler CI/CD pipeline

### For Security

- Dependabot still provides security alerts
- GitHub Security still scans for vulnerabilities
- Branch protection still enforces code review

---

## Future Considerations

### If You Need External Services

**Snyk:**

- Can be re-added if advanced security scanning needed
- Requires Snyk account and token
- File available in git history

**SonarCloud:**

- Can be re-added if code quality metrics needed
- Requires SonarCloud account and token
- File available in git history

**Repo Doctor:**

- Can be re-added if automated formatting PRs desired
- No external dependencies
- File available in git history

### To Restore

```bash
# View deleted files
git log --diff-filter=D --summary

# Restore specific workflow
git checkout c23d0b45 -- .github/workflows/snyk.yml
```

---

## Summary

✅ **Simplified from 7 to 4 workflows**  
✅ **Removed external service dependencies**  
✅ **Maintained all essential checks**  
✅ **Faster CI/CD pipeline**  
✅ **Easier to maintain**

The repository now has a lean, focused CI/CD pipeline that validates code quality, runs tests, and enforces branch protection without external dependencies.
