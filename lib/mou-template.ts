This Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") outlines the partnership between:

("Program Holder" or "Training Provider")

together referred to as the "Parties."

1. PURPOSE OF THIS MOU

The purpose of this MOU is to establish a clear, written understanding of how Elevate and the Program Holder will work together to deliver workforce training programs (for example: WRG, WIOA, JRI, EmployIndy, DOL-registered apprenticeships, and other aligned initiatives) and how revenue will be shared for eligible, funded participants who complete training and/or earn credentials.

2. ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

2.1 Elevate for Humanity will:

a. Serve as the primary training sponsor and system of record for the programs listed in this MOU.

b. Provide and maintain the Elevate Learning Management System (LMS), participant portal, case notes, certificates, and reporting tools.

c. Coordinate with state and local workforce agencies, credentialing partners, and funding sources to keep programs compliant and in good standing.

d. Enroll participants into approved training tracks and track participation, training hours, completions, and certifications.

e. Manage collection of funds from workforce programs and other funders.

f. Calculate and issue revenue share payments to Program Holder according to the compensation structure described in Section 4.

2.2 Program Holder will:

a. Provide a safe, professional training environment for participants, including physical space and day-to-day supervision at the worksite or classroom.

b. Deliver hands-on training, coaching, and supervision consistent with the curriculum, scope of work, and compliance requirements provided by Elevate and/or credentialing partners.

c. Maintain reasonable attendance expectations, sign-in procedures, and communication with participants.

d. Enter case notes, progress updates, and follow-up information into the Elevate portal as requested.

e. Notify Elevate promptly of any issues that may impact a participant's participation, safety, or eligibility.

f. Comply with all applicable laws, policies, and regulations relating to workplace safety, nondiscrimination, confidentiality, and workforce programs.

3. PROGRAMS COVERED

This MOU may cover one or more training tracks, including but not limited to:

• Barber / Beauty Apprenticeship
• CNA / Patient Care / Home Health
• HVAC / Building Technician / Construction
• Peer Support / Recovery Coach
• Financial Literacy / Tax Training
• Other industry-recognized credential programs

Specific programs, credentials, and funding streams (WRG, WIOA, JRI, EmployIndy, DOL, etc.) may be added or updated in writing (email or signed addendum) without rewriting the entire MOU.

4. COMPENSATION AND REVENUE SHARE

4.1 Definition of Net Program Revenue

For each funded participant, Elevate may receive program revenue from one or more sources (for example: WRG, WIOA, JRI, EmployIndy, DOL, employer contributions, or tuition). For the purpose of this agreement, Net Program Revenue means:

Total eligible training revenue actually received by Elevate for that participant
MINUS direct, required program costs including:
• Credentialing partner fees (testing, licensing, third-party exam vendors)
• Required background checks, drug screens, or clearances
• Approved learner toolkits and required equipment (kits, books, scrubs, PPE, basic tools)
• Platform, processing, and compliance fees directly tied to that participant or that training program

Net Program Revenue is calculated at the participant/program level or in reasonable grouped batches, using documentation maintained by Elevate.

4.2 Program Holder Share (${payoutPercent}% Model)

For each eligible participant who is officially enrolled, funded, and started training under this MOU, the Program Holder will receive:

${payoutPercent}% of the Net Program Revenue associated with that participant's training track,

paid to Program Holder after:
• the participant's enrollment has been verified,
• agreed-upon credentialing and toolkit costs are accounted for,
• and funds have been received and cleared by Elevate.

Elevate retains the remaining Net Program Revenue to cover administrative, platform, staffing, compliance, and coordination costs.

4.3 Timing of Payments

a. Payments to Program Holder will generally be issued on a monthly or quarterly cycle, once funds have been received and reconciled by Elevate.

b. A summary statement can be provided showing:
   • Number of participants
   • Funding source(s)
   • Gross revenue, direct program expenses, and Net Program Revenue
   • Amount payable to Program Holder (${payoutPercent}% share)

4.4 Non-Funded / Free Participants

Some participants may be served under free, pilot, scholarship, or fully internally funded initiatives. Elevate may elect to include or exclude those participants from the revenue share. Any such exceptions will be clarified in writing (email or addendum) for transparency.

5. DATA, REPORTING, AND CASE NOTES

a. Elevate will provide Program Holder with secure access to the delegate portal to enter case notes, statuses (On Track, At Risk, Not Engaged), and follow-up dates for participants they host.

b. Program Holder agrees to record reasonable case notes and updates to support compliance with workforce program documentation and audits.

c. Elevate will maintain training records, certificates, and participation reports and may share aggregated or participant-level reports with agencies, funders, and employers as required by program rules and privacy laws.

6. TERM AND TERMINATION

a. This MOU becomes effective on the date of the last signature below and remains in effect until terminated by either party.

b. Either party may terminate this MOU with 30 days' written notice.

c. Elevate may suspend or terminate this agreement immediately in cases of serious non-compliance, safety concerns, fraud, or other material breach.

d. Upon termination, Elevate will pay any amounts already earned and due to Program Holder for participants who were properly enrolled and funded prior to the termination date, following the normal reconciliation process.

7. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR RELATIONSHIP

The Parties agree that Program Holder is an independent contractor. This MOU does not create an employment relationship, partnership, or joint venture. Program Holder is responsible for its own employees, taxes, insurance, and business operations.

8. NON-EXCLUSIVITY

This MOU is non-exclusive. Elevate may partner with other Program Holders, and Program Holder may work with other training sponsors, as long as such relationships do not violate program rules or confidentiality obligations.

9. ENTIRE UNDERSTANDING AND AMENDMENTS

This MOU represents the current understanding between the Parties regarding the subject matter described here. It may be updated or amended in writing (including email confirmation) agreed to by both Parties.

By signing below, the Parties acknowledge that they have read and understood this MOU and agree to its terms.
