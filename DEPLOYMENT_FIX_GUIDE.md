# üö® DEPLOYMENT FIX GUIDE

## Problem Summary

‚úÖ **SSG Implementation:** COMPLETE and WORKING  
‚úÖ **Local Build:** PERFECT - All routes have unique content  
‚úÖ **Code:** PUSHED to GitHub (commits a1f814a, 75226a4)  
‚ùå **Live Deployment:** NOT UPDATED - Still serving old build  

---

## Root Cause

**The deployment pipeline is not executing.** The code is perfect, but Cloudflare Pages is not receiving/building the new code.

**Most Likely:** GitHub Actions workflow is failing due to missing secrets.

---

## Fix Steps

### Option 1: Check GitHub Actions (RECOMMENDED)

1. **Go to GitHub Actions:**
   ```
   https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/actions
   ```

2. **Look for "Deploy to Cloudflare Pages" workflow**
   - Check if it ran after commits `a1f814a` or `75226a4`
   - If it shows ‚ùå (failed), click on it to see error logs
   - Common error: "Missing CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN"

3. **If workflow is failing, check secrets:**
   ```
   https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/settings/secrets/actions
   ```
   
   Required secrets:
   - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
   - `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN` (auto-provided by GitHub)

4. **Get Cloudflare credentials:**
   - Go to Cloudflare Dashboard: https://dash.cloudflare.com/
   - Navigate to: **My Profile** ‚Üí **API Tokens**
   - Create token with permissions:
     - Account: Cloudflare Pages (Edit)
     - Zone: Cache Purge, Zone Settings (Read)
   - Copy the token and add to GitHub Secrets

5. **Get Account ID:**
   - In Cloudflare Dashboard, go to **Pages** ‚Üí **elevateforhumanity**
   - Account ID is in the URL or right sidebar

6. **Get Zone ID:**
   - Go to **Websites** ‚Üí select your domain
   - Zone ID is in the right sidebar under "API"

7. **Re-run the workflow:**
   - Go back to GitHub Actions
   - Click on the failed workflow
   - Click "Re-run all jobs"

---

### Option 2: Check Cloudflare Pages Dashboard

1. **Go to Cloudflare Pages:**
   ```
   https://dash.cloudflare.com/
   ```

2. **Navigate to:** Pages ‚Üí elevateforhumanity

3. **Check "Deployments" tab:**
   - Look for recent deployments
   - If none after your commits, GitHub integration may be broken

4. **Check "Settings" ‚Üí "Builds & deployments":**
   - Verify **Build command:** `npm run build`
   - Verify **Build output directory:** `dist`
   - Verify **Root directory:** `/` (or blank)
   - Check if GitHub integration is connected

5. **If GitHub integration is missing:**
   - Click "Connect to Git"
   - Authorize GitHub
   - Select repository: elevateforhumanity/fix2
   - Select branch: main

---

### Option 3: Manual Deploy (QUICK FIX)

If you need the site live immediately while fixing the pipeline:

1. **Get Cloudflare API Token** (from dashboard as described above)

2. **Run from your local machine or Gitpod:**
   ```bash
   cd /workspaces/fix2
   export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN='your-token-here'
   npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=elevateforhumanity
   ```

3. **This will deploy the current `dist` folder directly**
   - Takes 1-2 minutes
   - Bypasses GitHub Actions
   - Temporary solution until pipeline is fixed

---

## Verification

After fixing the deployment, verify it worked:

```bash
# Check LMS page title
curl -s "https://elevateforhumanity.pages.dev/lms" | grep -o "<title>[^<]*</title>"

# Should return:
# <title>Learning Management System ‚Äî Elevate for Humanity</title>

# Check for Vike markers
curl -s "https://elevateforhumanity.pages.dev/lms" | grep -c "vike_pageContext"

# Should return: 1 (or higher)
```

---

## Expected Results

Once deployment is fixed, each route will have unique content:

| Route | Title | Content |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `/` | Elevate for Humanity ‚Äî Workforce Development & Apprenticeships | Stats, featured programs |
| `/lms` | Learning Management System ‚Äî Elevate for Humanity | Courses, progress tracking |
| `/programs` | Workforce Training Programs ‚Äî Elevate for Humanity | Program listings |
| `/about` | About Us ‚Äî Elevate for Humanity | Mission, credentials |
| `/contact` | Contact Us ‚Äî Elevate for Humanity | Contact form |

## Technical Details

**What changed:**
- Implemented Vike (vite-plugin-ssr) for Static Site Generation
- Each route now pre-renders to unique HTML at build time
- Search engines see actual content, not empty shell

**Build output:**
```
dist/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              (Homepage)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lms/index.html          (LMS page)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ programs/index.html     (Programs page)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ about/index.html        (About page)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ contact/index.html      (Contact page)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                 (JS/CSS bundles)
```

**Local preview:**
The build is working perfectly locally. You can verify at:

## Need Help?

If you're still stuck after trying these steps:

1. Share the GitHub Actions error log
2. Share a screenshot of Cloudflare Pages deployments tab
3. Confirm which secrets are configured in GitHub

The code is ready. We just need to get the deployment pipeline working.
