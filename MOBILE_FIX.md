# 📱 MOBILE FIX - Do This From Your Phone

## Step 1: Open GitHub Actions on Phone

## Step 3: Run It

1. Tap **"Run workflow"** button
2. Make sure **"main"** branch is selected
3. Tap the green **"Run workflow"** button

## Step 4: Wait

The workflow will run for 3-5 minutes. You'll see:

- ✅ Green checkmarks as each step completes
- ✅ "Success" when done

## Step 5: Check the Site
