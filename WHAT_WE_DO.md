## Common Questions

### "So you're like a school?"
Yes, but we're a **workforce training provider**, not a traditional school. We focus on:
- Short-term training (4-24 weeks)
- Job-ready skills
- Industry certifications
- Direct employer connections

### "Do I have to pay you back?"
**NO!** These are grants, not loans. You never pay anything back.

### "What's JRI?"
**Job Ready Indy** - EmployIndy's soft skills curriculum that teaches:
- How to show up on time
- How to communicate professionally
- How to work in teams
- How to manage money
- How to advance in your career

We include JRI in all our programs because employers want workers with both technical AND soft skills.

### "What's OJT?"
**On-the-Job Training** - You get hired by an employer and they pay you while you train. The government reimburses the employer 50% of your wages for the training period (usually 3-6 months). You're a real employee earning real wages.

### "What's WEX?"
**Work Experience** - A short-term paid work placement (4-12 weeks) to help you get experience. Usually pays $15/hour. Helps you build your resume and references.

### "What's an apprenticeship?"
A **DOL Registered Apprenticeship** is a formal earn-while-you-learn program where you:
- Work full-time for an employer (get paid full wages)
- Complete classroom training (we provide this)
- Build required hours toward a license or credential
- Get a nationally recognized certificate when done

Example: Barber apprentices work in a real barbershop, serve real clients, earn $15-$20/hour, and build the 1,500 hours needed for their barber license.
