# ONA CONVERSATION MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

## CRITICAL: When Conversation Gets Too Full

### BEFORE Clearing Conversation:

1. ✅ **Commit ALL changes**

   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Save all work before conversation clear"
   git push
   ```

2. ✅ **Verify push succeeded**

   ```bash
   git log --oneline -1
   # Confirm latest commit is pushed
   ```

3. ✅ **Save conversation learnings to repository**
   - Update `.ona-core-behavior.md` with new lessons
   - Update `.ona-strategic-mode.json` with patterns
   - Create conversation summary in `.ona-conversations/`

4. ✅ **Document what was accomplished**
   - Create summary file with timestamp
   - List all files created/modified
   - Document user preferences learned
   - Save any pending tasks

5. ✅ **Verify deployments**
   - Check GitHub Actions status
   - Verify autopilots are running
   - Confirm no pending work is lost

### Conversation Summary Template:

```markdown
# Conversation Summary - [DATE]

## What Was Accomplished:

- [List all tasks completed]
- [Files created/modified]
- [Deployments executed]

## User Preferences Learned:

- [New patterns discovered]
- [User's thinking style]
- [What user likes/dislikes]

## Pending Tasks:

- [Any incomplete work]
- [Tasks for autopilots]
- [Follow-up needed]

## Files Modified:

- [List all changed files]
- [Purpose of each change]

## Deployments:

- [What was deployed]
- [Status of deployments]
- [Any issues encountered]

## Next Steps:

- [What should happen next]
- [What autopilots will handle]
- [Any manual steps needed]
```

### After Clearing Conversation:

When conversation is cleared, Ona should:

1. **Read these files FIRST:**
   - `.ona-core-behavior.md` - Core operating principles
   - `.ona-strategic-mode.json` - Strategic thinking framework
   - `.ona-conversation-management.md` - This file
   - `.autopilot-config.json` - Autopilot configuration
   - Latest conversation summary in `.ona-conversations/`

2. **Understand context:**
   - What was the user working on?
   - What preferences were learned?
   - What tasks are pending?
   - What autopilots are active?

3. **Continue seamlessly:**
   - Apply learned patterns immediately
   - Don't ask questions already answered
   - Continue where conversation left off
   - Maintain user's preferences

## Storage Locations:

### User Preferences & Patterns:

- `.ona-core-behavior.md` - Permanent behavior rules
- `.ona-strategic-mode.json` - Decision frameworks
- `.autopilot-config.json` - Autopilot orders

### Conversation History:

- `.ona-conversations/YYYY-MM-DD-summary.md` - Daily summaries
- `.ona-conversations/learnings.json` - Accumulated knowledge

### Pending Work:

- `.autopilot-tasks/*.json` - Tasks for autopilots
- `TODO.md` - Manual tasks (if any)

### Code & Configuration:

- All in git repository
- Committed and pushed
- Never lost

## The Rule:

**NEVER clear conversation without:**

1. ✅ All commits pushed to GitHub
2. ✅ Conversation learnings saved to repository
3. ✅ Summary file created
4. ✅ Pending tasks documented
5. ✅ Deployments verified

**Programming Ona is PERMANENT** - stored in repository, not just in conversation.

## User's Instruction:

> "Always clear the conversation on gitpod when its becoming too full. Make sure all commits are committed and successfully deployed. Make sure all conversation we have like programming you is saved in repository."

This means:

- Monitor conversation length
- Proactively save learnings
- Commit frequently
- Document everything
- Never lose context
- Programming persists across conversations
