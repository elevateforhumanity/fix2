PROMPT FOR CHATGPT:

I need you to format certification application information into clean, printable documents. I will provide you with application data in markdown format. Please:

1. Convert the markdown to a clean, professional format
2. Create a table of contents
3. Format sections with clear headers
4. Make it print-friendly (black and white, clear fonts)
5. Add page breaks between major sections
6. Create a cover page with:
   - Application name
   - Business name
   - Date
   - Prepared by: Elizabeth L. Greene

7. For each section:
   - Bold the question/field name
   - Regular text for the answer
   - Use checkboxes where applicable
   - Highlight [PLACEHOLDER] items in a different format so I know to fill them in

8. At the end, create a checklist of:
   - Required documents
   - Information still needed (all [PLACEHOLDER] items)
   - Next steps

9. Format for easy manual data entry:
   - Clear field labels
   - Adequate spacing
   - Easy to read when printed

10. Create separate documents for each certification:
    - 8(a) Business Development
    - DBE/ACDBE
    - Indiana MBE/WBE
    - Buy Indiana
    - WOSB/EDWOSB
    - HUBZone

Please confirm you're ready, and I'll paste the first application data.

AFTER CHATGPT CONFIRMS, PASTE EACH APPLICATION FILE CONTENT ONE AT A TIME:

1. First paste: 01_8A_BUSINESS_DEVELOPMENT.md content
2. Wait for formatted output
3. Then paste: 02_DBE_ACDBE_CERTIFICATION.md content
4. Wait for formatted output
5. Continue for all 6 applications

ALTERNATIVE PROMPT (If you want all at once):

I have 6 certification applications in markdown format. Please create a comprehensive application package with:

1. Master cover page listing all 6 certifications
2. Table of contents with page numbers
3. Each application formatted as a separate section
4. Professional formatting for printing
5. Highlight all [PLACEHOLDER] items
6. Create a master checklist at the end showing:
   - All required documents across all applications
   - All information still needed
   - Timeline for each certification
   - Priority order recommendations

Format everything for easy printing and manual data entry into online portals.

Ready? I'll paste all 6 applications now.

[Then paste all 6 application files]
