- Evaluate set-aside eligibility
- Assess financial capacity
- Consult legal/financial advisors

**3. Maintain Both Registrations**
- Renew BOTH annually
- Update BOTH when information changes
- Monitor BOTH for compliance
- Keep BOTH active and current

**4. Avoid Conflicts**

- Maintain clear separation
- Follow federal regulations
- Consult with contracting officers if unsure

**5. Leverage Both**
