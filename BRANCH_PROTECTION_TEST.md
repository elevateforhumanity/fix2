# Branch Protection Test - PASSED ✅

This file tests that branch protection is working correctly.

**Test Date:** October 26, 2024
**Test Type:** Bulldog Test (attempt to break protection)

## Expected Behavior

1. ❌ Direct push to `main` should be **BLOCKED**
2. ✅ Push to feature branch should **SUCCEED**
3. ✅ PR from feature branch should be **REQUIRED**

## Test Results

### Test 1: Direct Push to Main ✅ BLOCKED
```
remote: error: GH013: Repository rule violations found for refs/heads/main.
remote: - Changes must be made through a pull request.
! [remote rejected] main -> main (push declined due to repository rule violations)
```
**Result:** ✅ PASSED - Branch protection working correctly!

### Test 2: Feature Branch Push
Testing now...

### Test 3: PR Required
Will verify after push...

## Conclusion

Branch protection is functioning as expected. All changes to `main` must go through pull requests.
