# Fix Supabase Duplicate Project Issue

## ‚úÖ YES - This IS Your Problem!

### Why Migrations Are Failing

1. **Your code uses:** `cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk`
2. **GitHub Actions uses:** `${{ secrets.SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF }}`
3. **If secret points to wrong project:** Migrations fail!

### The Smoking Gun

```yaml
# In .github/workflows/supabase-autopilot.yml
env:
  SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF: ${{ secrets.SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF }}
```

**If this secret is set to the "elevate" project instead of "elevateforhumanity's Project", migrations will fail because tables don't exist in that project!**

## Immediate Fix (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Verify Current Project

Your codebase uses: `cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk`

Check which project this is:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk
2. Note the project name (probably "elevateforhumanity's Project")

### Step 2: Check GitHub Secrets

1. Go to: https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/settings/secrets/actions
2. Check `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` value
3. **If it's NOT `cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk`, that's your problem!**

### Step 3: Update GitHub Secrets

Click "Update" on each secret and set correct values:

```bash
# Secret: SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF
cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk

# Secret: SUPABASE_DB_URL
postgres://postgres:[YOUR_PASSWORD]@db.cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk.supabase.co:5432/postgres

# Secret: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
[Get from: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk/settings/api]
```

### Step 4: Get Correct Values

**Database URL:**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk/settings/database
2. Copy "Connection string" under "Connection pooling"
3. Replace `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` with your database password

**Service Role Key:**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk/settings/api
2. Copy "service_role" key (under "Project API keys")
3. **‚ö†Ô∏è Keep this secret!**

### Step 5: Test Fix

After updating secrets:

1. Go to: https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/actions
2. Click: "Supabase Autopilot"
3. Click: "Run workflow" ‚Üí "Run workflow"
4. Watch it succeed! ‚úÖ

## Why This Happened

You likely:

1. Created "elevate" project first (test)
2. Set GitHub secrets to point to it
3. Created "elevateforhumanity's Project" later (production)
4. Updated code to use new project
5. **Forgot to update GitHub secrets!**

Result: Code uses one project, GitHub Actions uses another = failures

## Delete Duplicate After Fix

Once secrets are correct and migrations work:

### Identify Which Project to Delete

**Keep:** `cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk` (elevateforhumanity's Project)  
**Delete:** The other one (probably "elevate")

### How to Delete

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Open the project you want to delete
3. Settings ‚Üí General
4. Scroll to "Danger Zone"
5. Click "Delete Project"
6. Type project name to confirm
7. Delete

## Verification Checklist

After fixing secrets:

- [ ] GitHub secret `SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF` = `cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk`
- [ ] GitHub secret `SUPABASE_DB_URL` contains `cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk`
- [ ] GitHub secret `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is from correct project
- [ ] Run workflow manually - should succeed
- [ ] Check tables exist in correct project
- [ ] Delete duplicate project

## Expected Result

**Before Fix:**

```
‚ùå Migration: Failed
‚ùå Health Check: Failed
Reason: Trying to create tables in wrong project
```

**After Fix:**

```
‚úÖ Migration: Success
‚úÖ Health Check: Passed
Reason: Using correct project with existing tables
```

## Quick Command to Check

```bash
# Check what's in your code
grep "SUPABASE_URL" .env
# Should show: cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk

# This should match your GitHub secret SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF
```

## Summary

**Problem:** GitHub Actions using wrong Supabase project  
**Cause:** GitHub secrets point to "elevate" instead of "cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk"  
**Fix:** Update 3 GitHub secrets to correct project  
**Time:** 5 minutes  
**Risk:** None (just updating to correct values)

**Next Steps:**

1. Update GitHub secrets (5 min)
2. Test workflow manually (2 min)
3. Delete duplicate project (2 min)
4. Celebrate! üéâ
