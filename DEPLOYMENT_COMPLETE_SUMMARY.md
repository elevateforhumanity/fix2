## 📋 Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Database Migrations (5 minutes)

Go to [Supabase SQL Editor](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk/sql/new) and run each migration:

1. `001_initial_schema.sql` - Base tables
2. `002_lms_schema.sql` - LMS tables
3. `003_lms_seed_data.sql` - Sample data
4. `004_agent_events.sql` - Audit log
5. `005_affiliate_system.sql` - Affiliate tables
6. `006_files_and_payments.sql` - Files + donations
7. `007_stripe_connect.sql` - Connect integration

### Step 2: Supabase Edge Function (2 minutes)

```bash
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref cuxzzpsyufcewtmicszk
supabase functions deploy executeAction
```

### Step 3: Cloudflare Setup (10 minutes)

1. **Create API Token** with R2 permissions:
   - Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com/6ba1d2a52a3fa230972960db307ac7c0/api-tokens
   - Create token with: Workers R2 Storage (Edit), Workers Scripts (Edit)
   - Export: `export CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="your-token"`

2. **Create R2 Buckets:**
   ```bash
   wrangler r2 bucket create efh-private
   wrangler r2 bucket create efh-private-staging
   ```

3. **Set Worker Secrets:**
   ```bash
   cd workers/agent
   wrangler secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
   wrangler secret put SUPABASE_FUNCTION_URL
   wrangler secret put SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
   wrangler secret put SUPABASE_URL
   wrangler secret put SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
   wrangler secret put STRIPE_SECRET_KEY
   wrangler secret put STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
   ```

4. **Deploy Worker:**
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy agent-worker.js --config wrangler.toml
   ```

### Step 4: Stripe Webhook (3 minutes)

1. Go to: https://dashboard.stripe.com/webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://efh-agent.your-subdomain.workers.dev/webhooks/stripe`
3. Select events: `checkout.session.completed`, `payment_intent.succeeded`
4. Copy webhook secret and set as Worker secret

### Step 5: Test (5 minutes)

```bash
# Test agent
curl https://efh-agent.your-subdomain.workers.dev \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"Show me the stats"}'

# Test file upload
# Use FileUpload component in your frontend

# Test Stripe checkout
# Use createEnrollmentCheckout() helper
```
