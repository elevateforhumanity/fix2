## 🎤 Full Script (90 seconds)

### Opening (0:00 - 0:10)

**Visual:** Elevate Connects logo → Platform dashboard

**Voiceover:**

> "Most LMS platforms were built for selling online courses. Elevate Connects was built for something more important: real workforce training that leads to real careers."

**Text Overlay:** "The LMS Built for Workforce Training"

---

### Problem Statement (0:10 - 0:25)

**Visual:** Quick cuts of Moodle, Docebo, LearnWorlds logos → X marks

**Voiceover:**

> "Platforms like Moodle, Docebo, and LearnWorlds are powerful — but they weren't designed for WRG, WIOA, JRI, EmployIndy, or DOL apprenticeship programs. They don't have case management. They don't have program holder portals. They don't track workforce compliance."

**Text Overlay:** "Generic LMS ≠ Workforce Training"

---

### Solution Overview (0:25 - 0:45)

**Visual:** Four portal views in grid layout

**Voiceover:**

> "Elevate Connects brings together four portals in one platform:
>
> A student portal where learners track courses, assignments, grades, and certificates.
>
> An admin portal where you manage training providers, review applications, and generate compliance reports.
>
> A program holder portal where barbershops, CNA schools, and HVAC partners track their participants and revenue share.
>
> And a delegate portal where case managers monitor caseloads, log notes, and track engagement."

**Text Overlay:**

- "Student Portal"
- "Admin Portal"
- "Program Holder Portal"
- "Delegate Portal"

---

### Key Features (0:45 - 1:05)

**Visual:** Quick feature demonstrations

**Voiceover:**

> "We have everything you'd expect: courses, learning paths, assignments, grades, certificates, and reports.
>
> Plus features the big LMS platforms don't offer:
>
> Digital MOU signing with two-step workflow and automatic PDF generation.
>
> Public certificate verification with QR codes for employers.
>
> Workforce enrollment flows built for funded programs.
>
> And caseload reports that show who's on track, who's at risk, and who needs support."

**Text Overlay:**

- "Digital MOUs ✓"
- "Certificate Verification ✓"
- "Workforce Enrollment ✓"
- "Caseload Tracking ✓"

---

### Differentiation (1:05 - 1:20)

**Visual:** Side-by-side comparison chart

**Voiceover:**

> "Where we're different is focus. Moodle and Docebo are built for corporate training and online courses. Elevate is built for workforce programs — where compliance matters, case management matters, and real partnerships matter.
>
> We're not just an LMS. We're a complete workforce training system."

**Text Overlay:** "Not Just an LMS. A Workforce Training System."

---

### Call to Action (1:20 - 1:30)

**Visual:** Platform montage → Contact form

**Voiceover:**

> "If you're running WRG, WIOA, JRI, or DOL programs, and you need more than just a course catalog — Elevate Connects is built for you.
>
> Schedule a demo today."

**Text Overlay:**

- "Schedule a Demo"
