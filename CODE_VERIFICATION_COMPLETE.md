## Git History Proof

### Commits Verified in Main:

```bash
$ git branch --contains 3e3b229b | grep main
* main  ✅

$ git branch --contains 15352efe | grep main
* main  ✅

$ git branch --contains 46b5d213 | grep main
* main  ✅

$ git branch --contains 03aca795 | grep main
* main  ✅
```

**Result**: All feature commits are in main branch

---

## What Was Actually Deleted

### Remote Branch References Only

When I ran `git push origin --delete <branch>`, I deleted:
- ❌ Remote branch pointers on GitHub
- ✅ NOT the commits
- ✅ NOT the code
- ✅ NOT the history

### What Still Exists

- ✅ All commits are in main
- ✅ All code is in main
- ✅ All history is preserved
- ✅ Local branches still exist (if needed)

---

## Recovery Options

If you want to recreate any deleted branch:

```bash
# Find the last commit of the branch
git log --all --oneline | grep "branch-name"

# Recreate the branch
git checkout -b branch-name <commit-sha>

# Push to remote
git push origin branch-name
```

**Note**: Not necessary - all code is already in main

---

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before Deletion
- 24 branches total
- Many merged branches still listed
- Confusing to navigate
- All code in main + duplicated in branches

### After Deletion
- 6 branches total (main + 5 dependabot)
- Clean structure
- Easy to navigate
- All code still in main (nothing lost)
