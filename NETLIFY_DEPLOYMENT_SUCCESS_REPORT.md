## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### If Deployment Fails:

#### 1. Check Build Logs

```bash
# View Netlify build logs
netlify logs

# Or check GitHub Actions logs
gh run list
gh run view [run-id]
```

#### 2. Run Autopilot Script Again

```bash
./autopilot-deploy-fix.sh
```

#### 3. Verify Environment Variables

```bash
# Check if all required env vars are set
netlify env:list
```

#### 4. Clear Netlify Cache

```bash
# Clear build cache
netlify build --clear-cache
```

#### 5. Manual Build Test

```bash
# Test build locally
pnpm run build

# Check for errors
echo $?  # Should output 0 for success
```
