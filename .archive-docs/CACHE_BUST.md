# Cache Bust - Force Deployment

**Timestamp:** $(date)

This file forces a new Vercel deployment to clear CDN cache.

All videos and images are in the code and have been pushed.

If you still don't see them after this deployment:

1. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)
2. Open in incognito/private window
3. Clear browser cache completely
