# EVALUATION PROMPT: PARTNERSHIP VERSION

> You are acting as a senior partnership director at a workforce development organization, community college, or nonprofit training provider. You evaluate potential technology partners, platform providers, and collaborative opportunities for strategic fit, operational feasibility, and mutual benefit.

Evaluate the following partnership opportunity with practical realism:

---

## 1. PARTNER PROFILE & ORGANIZATIONAL FIT

**Potential Partner:**

- Organization: Workforce training platform provider
- Legal Status: 501(c)(3) nonprofit
- Founded: February 2025 (10 months operational)
- Leadership: Solo founder, technical background
- Current Scale: No active customers, pilot-ready platform

**Partnership Proposal:**

- Your organization operates under their ETPL/WIOA credentials via MOU
- They provide platform, compliance automation, and reporting
- You pay monthly licensing fee ($2K-$15K based on size)
- They handle Indiana DWD reporting and compliance monitoring
- You focus on student recruitment and instruction

**Strategic Fit Assessment:**

- Does this align with our mission?
- Does this solve a real problem we have?
- Is this better than our current approach?
- What's the risk vs. reward?

**What You Give:**

---

## 3. VERIFICATION REQUIREMENT (Due Diligence)

Before committing, verify:

### 3.1 Technical Verification

- [ ] Platform demo (live, not slides)
- [ ] Test account access (try it yourself)
- [ ] Data security review (how is our data protected?)
- [ ] Uptime/reliability (what's their track record?)
- [ ] Integration capabilities (works with our systems?)

### 3.2 Legal Verification

- [ ] MOU review by attorney
- [ ] Credential-sharing legality (confirmed with Indiana DWD?)
- [ ] Data ownership (who owns student data?)
- [ ] Liability (who's responsible if something goes wrong?)
- [ ] Exit terms (can we leave if it doesn't work?)

### 3.3 Operational Verification

- [ ] Pilot results (do they have proof it works?)
- [ ] Support capacity (can they handle our volume?)
- [ ] Compliance track record (any violations?)

---

## 4. RISK ASSESSMENT

### 4.1 Partnership Risks

**HIGH RISK:**

- **New Organization:** Less than 1 year old, no track record
- **No Other Customers:** We'd be the first (or among first)
- **Single Founder:** Key person dependency, no team
- **Unproven Model:** No operational validation
- **Legal Uncertainty:** Credential-sharing model not validated

**MEDIUM RISK:**

- **Technical Complexity:** Platform not fully deployed
- **Compliance Automation:** Not yet tested with real data
- **Support Capacity:** Solo founder can't support many partners
- **Financial Stability:** No revenue, operating under constraints

**LOW RISK:**

- **Technology Stack:** Modern, standard tools
- **Mission Alignment:** Nonprofit, workforce-focused
- **Pricing:** Competitive with alternatives

### 4.2 Operational Risks

**What Could Go Wrong:**

1. Platform crashes or has downtime
2. Compliance automation fails (we get flagged by Indiana DWD)
3. Data migration loses student records
4. Founder leaves or organization shuts down
5. Indiana DWD disallows credential-sharing model
6. Costs increase unexpectedly
7. Platform doesn't integrate with our systems
8. Support is inadequate

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- Start with small pilot (10-20 students)
- Keep backup of all student data
- Month-to-month contract (easy exit)
- Legal review of MOU
- Confirm with Indiana DWD before signing
- Document all processes (in case we need to switch)

### 4.3 Opportunity Costs

**What We Give Up:**

- Time spent on this vs. other priorities
- Money spent on this vs. other investments
- Control over our operations
- Direct relationship with Indiana DWD
- Flexibility to customize our approach

**Is It Worth It?**

- Only if: Cost savings + new revenue > licensing fee + opportunity cost
- And: Risk is acceptable given our risk tolerance
