## ⚠️ ONE-TIME MANUAL STEP

The autopilot **CANNOT** directly edit your Durable.co site.

You need to do this **ONCE**:

### Step 1: Get the Integration Code

The puppet autopilot has generated the code for you:

**File:** `PUPPET_DURABLE_INTEGRATION.html`

### Step 2: Add to Durable

1. Log into Durable.co
2. Go to your site: www.elevateforhumanity.org
3. Go to **Settings** → **Custom Code**
4. Find the **Head Section**
5. Paste this:

```html
<script
  src="https://elevateforhumanityfix2.netlify.app/efh-bridge.js"
  data-efh-org="elevate-for-humanity"
  data-env="prod"
  defer
></script>
```

### Step 3: Add Content Slots

1. Edit your Durable pages
2. Add HTML blocks where you want content
3. Paste these slots:

```html
<div data-efh-slot="hero"></div>
<div data-efh-slot="programs"></div>
<div data-efh-slot="features"></div>
<div data-efh-slot="testimonials"></div>
<div data-efh-slot="cta"></div>
```

### Step 4: Save and Publish

That's it! After this **ONE-TIME** setup, everything is automatic.

---

## ✅ After You Add the Code

Once you add the code to Durable, the autopilot will:

- ✅ Deploy updates automatically (every hour)
- ✅ Monitor health continuously (every 30 min)
- ✅ Fix issues immediately (every 5 min)
- ✅ Push changes automatically (every 30 min)
- ✅ Update content automatically (on changes)
- ✅ Generate reports automatically (continuous)

## 💡 How It Works

### The Autonomous Loop

```
1. Master Orchestrator wakes up (every 30 min)
2. Triggers all other autopilots
3. Autonomous Netlify Deploy builds and deploys
4. Puppet checks bridge and generates code
5. Health monitors verify everything
6. Auto-push commits any fixes
7. Self-heal fixes any issues
8. Repeat forever
```

### Zero Manual Intervention

After you add the code to Durable:

- **Content updates?** Automatic
- **Bridge updates?** Automatic
- **Health monitoring?** Automatic
- **Issue fixing?** Automatic
- **Deployments?** Automatic
- **Code generation?** Automatic
- **Status reports?** Automatic

**You do:** NOTHING! 🎉

## 📞 Support

### If Something Goes Wrong

The autopilot will:
1. Detect the issue (within 5 minutes)
2. Attempt to fix it automatically
3. Create an alert if it can't fix it
4. Generate a detailed report

### Check Status

- **GitHub Actions:** https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/actions
- **Netlify:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/elevateforhumanityfix2
- **Logs:** Check workflow run logs

### Manual Override

If you need to manually trigger something:

```bash
# Trigger master orchestrator
gh workflow run master-orchestrator.yml

# Trigger Netlify deploy
gh workflow run autonomous-netlify-deploy.yml

# Trigger puppet integration
gh workflow run puppet-durable-integration.yml

# Trigger health check
gh workflow run durable-bridge-autopilot.yml
```
