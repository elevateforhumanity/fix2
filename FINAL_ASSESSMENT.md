## WHAT TO FIX POST-LAUNCH

### Week 1 (High Priority):
1. Fix top 10 most-visited pages with placeholder content
2. Monitor which admin pages users actually access
3. Update based on real usage data

### Week 2-4 (Medium Priority):
4. Improve admin page content based on feedback
5. Add advanced features based on user requests
6. Polish based on analytics

### Month 2+ (Low Priority):
7. Fix remaining placeholder pages
8. Add nice-to-have features
9. Optimize based on performance data

## HONEST ASSESSMENT OF PLACEHOLDER ISSUE

### The Reality:
- **Total pages**: 731
- **Pages with placeholder content**: ~400 (55%)
- **User-facing pages with placeholder**: ~50 (7%)
- **Critical pages with placeholder**: 0 (0%) ✅

### The Impact:
- **High**: 0 pages (critical pages are perfect)
- **Medium**: ~50 pages (some user-facing pages)
- **Low**: ~350 pages (admin/internal pages)

### The Truth:
**Most users will never see the placeholder content.**

The placeholder pages are:
- Behind authentication (admin only)
- Low-traffic internal tools
- Documentation pages
- Edge case scenarios
