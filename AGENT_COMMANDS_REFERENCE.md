## üí° Tips

### Natural Language Mode
- Be specific with amounts and IDs
- Include all required information in one sentence
- Use clear, direct language

**Good:**
```
"Create a Tax Prep program for $2500, 80 hours, CIP 52.0304"
```

**Bad:**
```
"Make a program" (missing details)
```

### Structured Mode
- Select command from dropdown
- Fill in all required fields (marked with *)
- Use UUIDs for IDs (copy from database)
- Validate data before executing

---

## üîç Finding IDs

### Program IDs
```sql
SELECT id, title FROM courses WHERE published = true;
```

### User/Student IDs
```sql
SELECT id, email, full_name FROM profiles WHERE role = 'student';
```

### Affiliate IDs
```sql
SELECT id, user_id, tier FROM affiliates WHERE status = 'active';
```

### Enrollment IDs
```sql
SELECT id, user_id, course_id, status FROM enrollments;
```

---

## üìù Audit Trail

All agent actions are logged to the `agent_events` table:

```sql
-- View recent actions
SELECT * FROM agent_events
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- View failed actions
SELECT * FROM agent_events
WHERE success = false
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Actions by type
SELECT action, COUNT(*) as count
FROM agent_events
GROUP BY action
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Critical Operations**: Use structured mode for payouts and tuition changes
2. **Audit Compliance**: All actions are logged with timestamp and user
3. **Role Enforcement**: Commands are blocked if user lacks required role
4. **Data Validation**: Invalid parameters will be rejected
5. **Idempotency**: Some actions (like createProgram) can be run multiple times safely

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "Forbidden: Your role cannot execute..."
- Check your user role in profiles table
- Contact admin to update your role if needed

### "Unknown action"
- Verify command name matches catalog exactly
- Check for typos in natural language prompt

### "Missing required parameter"
- Ensure all required fields are provided
- Use structured mode to see required fields

### "Invalid UUID format"
- Copy IDs directly from database
- UUIDs must be in format: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
