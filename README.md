# Elevate for Humanity – Workforce LMS + Case Management

Elevate for Humanity is a workforce-first LMS and directory built for real programs like **WRG, WIOA, JRI, EmployIndy, DOL apprenticeships, and employer-sponsored upskilling**.

- A full **Student/Learner portal**
- An **Admin portal** for training sponsors
- A **Program Holder portal** for barbershops, CNA schools, HVAC partners, etc.
- A **Delegate/Case Manager portal** for workforce agencies
- **Public verification & enrollment** pages

## 🌱 Student / Learner Portal

- **Dashboard** – at-a-glance view of active training
- **Courses & Learning Paths** – structured programs instead of random standalone lessons
- **Assignments & Grades** – track what's due and what's completed

- **Workforce Enrollment** – specialized flows for funded programs (WRG, WIOA, JRI, etc.)
- **My Certificates** – view, download, and share credentials
- **Messages & Notifications** – built-in communication with admins, providers, and coaches
- **Calendar & Resources** – upcoming sessions, deadlines, and support resources
- **Profile** – update contact info and preferences

---

## 🏛 Admin Portal (Training Sponsor / System Owner)

- **Training Providers (Program Holders)** – Manage the organizations that host training (barbershops, CNA schools, HVAC shops, etc.)
- **Review Applications** – Approve or decline new program holder applications
- **Manage Delegates** – Invite and manage case managers / delegates for each provider
- **Reports Hub** – Central reporting for participation, completions, certificates, and funding programs
- **Caseload Report** – WRG/WIOA-style view of who is On Track / At Risk / Not Engaged

---

## 🧩 Program Holder Portal (Training Providers)

For barbers, CNA owners, HVAC/Construction partners, and other training sites:

- **Provider Dashboard** – overview of learners, caseload, and payouts
- **Self-Service Application** – become a training provider inside the platform
- **Digital MOU Signing** – sign Elevate's revenue-share agreement online

Program holders can see their participants, track progress, add case notes, and eventually receive payout reports tied to funded enrollments.

## 👥 Delegate Portal (Case Managers / Navigators)

For workforce staff and case managers:

- **Delegate Reports** – view learner progress, case notes, and follow-up dates per provider and program

This turns Elevate into a **lightweight case management layer** on top of the LMS.

## 🎥 Video Demo Scripts

### Clip 1: "What Elevate Is" (30-40s)

> "Most LMS platforms like Moodle, Docebo, and LearnWorlds were built for generic online courses. Elevate for Humanity is different. We combine a full student portal, an admin portal, a program holder portal, and a delegate case-manager portal in one place — built around real workforce programs like WRG, WIOA, JRI, EmployIndy, and DOL apprenticeships.
>
> Learners see courses, assignments, grades, progress, certificates, and workforce enrollment. Admins see training providers, applications, reports, caseloads, and bulk certificates. Program holders sign their MOU, log in, and track their own participants. Case managers see live caseload reports, notes, and follow-ups.
>
> It's not just an LMS. It's a workforce training system."

### Clip 2: "How We Compare" (40-50s)

> "If you've looked at Moodle, Docebo, or LearnWorlds, you'll see a lot of the same checkboxes: dashboards, courses, learning paths, grades, certificates. Elevate already has those — plus things they don't give you out of the box:
>
> - Workforce enrollment flows
> - Partner and program holder onboarding with digital MOUs
> - Delegate and case manager portals tied to funding programs
> - Public certificate verification for employers
>
> Where we're different is focus: Elevate is built from day one around funded training, case notes, caseloads, and reporting back to agencies — not just selling courses."

### Clip 3: "What's on the Roadmap" (30-40s)

> "Feature-wise, we're catching up fast to the biggest LMS names. Next on our roadmap:
>
> - Interactive video lessons with transcripts and in-video quizzes
> - SCORM/xAPI import so you can bring in existing content
> - Light gamification so learners earn badges and milestones
> - Deeper integrations with Zoom and other tools
> - And optional eCommerce for providers who want to sell private courses on top of workforce programs.
>
> So if you want the structure of Moodle and Docebo, but tuned for real-world workforce training and funding — that's exactly what Elevate for Humanity is becoming."
