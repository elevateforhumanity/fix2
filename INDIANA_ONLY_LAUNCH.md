## ✅ PROGRAMS CLEARED FOR LAUNCH

All programs from INTraining are approved:

### Apprenticeships (Registered)

- ✅ Barber Apprenticeship (regulated hours, U.S. DOL registered)

### Training Programs (ETPL Listed)

- ✅ Esthetician Training
- ✅ Nail Technician Training
- ✅ Business Startup & Marketing
- ✅ Tax Preparation (VITA)
- ✅ Healthcare (CNA, Medical Assistant, Home Health Aide)
- ✅ HVAC Technician
- ✅ Building Technician

**Key Clarification:**

- Barber = Apprenticeship (regulated)
- Nails/Esthetics = Training programs (not auto-apprenticeship unless partnered with licensed school)
- Business/Tax/Healthcare/HVAC = Training programs

---

## 🤝 PARTNER POSITIONING (INDIANA-SAFE)

**For all Indiana partners:**

> "Elevate for Humanity is the Program Sponsor responsible for workforce system alignment, enrollment processing, and compliance reporting. Partners provide instruction and hands-on training. All enrollments flow through Elevate for Humanity. WorkOne coordination is managed by Elevate for Humanity."

**This protects you and keeps you compliant.**

---

## 📊 ATTENDANCE & SCHEDULE (INDIANA STANDARD)

**Your model is approved:**

- Weekly required hours (not daily)
- Self-paced + verified
- Evening reconciliation (7:30-9:00 PM ET)
- Flag if behind pace

**This aligns with:**

- WorkOne expectations
- Apprenticeship reporting norms
- ETPL documentation practices

**No changes needed.**

---

## 💳 STRIPE & PAYMENTS (INDIANA-APPROPRIATE)

**Your current model is correct:**

- Student does not pay EFH directly
- Stripe triggers after enrollment confirmation
- EFH pays partners milestone-based
- Partners provide access
- Payments tied to verified progress

**This is normal for Indiana workforce programs.**

**No changes needed.**

---
