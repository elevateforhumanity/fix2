## 🎯 Two Types of Programs

### 1. MICRO PROGRAMS (50% Split After 100% Markup)
**What They Are**: Pre-built courses from credentialed partners' catalogs - SOLD DIRECTLY BY ELEVATE on the website

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Can I offer all three types?**
A: Yes! You can offer micro programs from partners, your own ETPL programs, and apprenticeships.

**Q: Why is micro program split 50/50 but others 1/3?**
A: Micro programs are pre-built by partners. You're facilitating, not creating. ETPL and apprenticeships require you to develop and deliver instruction.

**Q: Can I customize micro programs?**
A: No. Micro programs are the partner's intellectual property. You facilitate their content as-is.

**Q: Can I import my LMS content for micro programs?**
A: No for micro programs (partner's content). Yes for ETPL and apprenticeship programs (your content).

**Q: Do all programs use the master syllabus?**
A: No. Only ETPL and apprenticeship programs use master syllabus. Micro programs use partner's curriculum.
