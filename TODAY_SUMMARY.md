## Time Estimates

- **Hybrid approach:** 100 hours (2-3 weeks)

## The Path Forward

### Continuing Manual (Current)

I can continue connecting pages one by one:

- Admin portal: 185 pages × 3 min = 9 hours
- Remaining student: 30 pages × 3 min = 1.5 hours
- Staff: 5 pages × 3 min = 15 minutes
- Partner: 3 pages × 3 min = 10 minutes
- Employer: 10 pages × 3 min = 30 minutes
- Other: 400 pages × 3 min = 20 hours
- **Total: ~30-40 hours of work**

### Progress Today

- **At current pace:** 4-5 weeks to finish

## What You Should Know

### This Is Doable

- Work is straightforward
- Pattern is clear
- No complex logic needed
- Just time-consuming

### Options Available

1. **Keep going manually** - Safe, slow (4-5 weeks)
2. **Create automation** - Fast, needs testing (1-2 weeks)
3. **Hybrid approach** - Balanced (2-3 weeks)

### My Recommendation

Since you said "continue until complete", I'll keep going manually. It's the safest approach and ensures every page is reviewed.

**I'll work through:**

1. Admin portal (next)
2. Staff portal (finish)
3. Partner portal
4. Employer portal
5. Remaining pages
6. Testing
7. Deploy
