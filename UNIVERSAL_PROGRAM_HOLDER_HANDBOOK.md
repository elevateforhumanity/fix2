## Universal Program Holder & Site Responsibility Handbook

This handbook explains what is expected from **program holders, training sites, and partner locations** that host Elevate for Humanity learners, apprentices, and participants.

## 1. Your Role as a Program Holder / Site Partner

As a program holder or site partner, you:

- Help learners connect classroom training to **real work and real expectations**.
- Communicate with Elevate staff and, when applicable, **case managers or boards**.

## 2. Learner Experience & Environment

Program holders agree to:

- Treat learners with **respect and dignity**, regardless of background or justice involvement.
- Maintain a worksite that is **physically safe and harassment-free**.
- Clearly explain:
  - Work hours and schedule expectations

If a learner is not a fit for your site, you **must contact Elevate** before terminating or sending them home permanently so we can support a transition and documentation.

  - What the learner is doing well
  - Where they need to improve
  - Any safety or conduct concerns

Elevate will:

- Offer coaching tools, checklists, and communication templates.
- Intervene when performance or behavior issues require a plan, not just discipline.
- Support additional training or remediation where appropriate.
