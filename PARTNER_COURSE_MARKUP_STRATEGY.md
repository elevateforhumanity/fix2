## 📊 Profit Optimization Strategies

### 1. **Volume Discounts**
- Negotiate better wholesale rates at 50, 100, 500 students
- Pass some savings to students, keep rest as profit
- Example: Certiport at $100/exam instead of $120 = $20 more profit

### 2. **Bundling**
- Higher perceived value
- Better margins (60-75% vs 30-50%)
- Harder to price compare

### 3. **Subscription Model**
- "All-Access Pass" - $99/month
- Unlimited micro-credentials
- Limited certifications (1-2 per month)
- Predictable recurring revenue

### 4. **Corporate Sales**
- Sell to employers in bulk
- 50-100 seats at a time
- Higher margins on volume
- Example: 100 OSHA 10 certs = $4,000 revenue, $1,500 cost = $2,500 profit

### 5. **White-Label Options**
- Negotiate with partners to remove their branding
- Issue certificates under YOUR brand
- Charge premium pricing
- Example: "Elevate for Humanity Certified Excel Specialist"
