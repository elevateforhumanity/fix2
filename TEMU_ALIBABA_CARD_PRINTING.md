- Cost: $0.05-0.20 per card

**What You Can Use Them For:**

**Where to Buy:**
- Temu: Search "blank PVC cards"

## The Real Problem: You Need a BIN

### What is a BIN?
**BIN = Bank Identification Number**
- First 6 digits of card number
- Identifies the issuing bank
- Required for Visa/Mastercard network
- Only banks can issue BINs
- You can't buy a BIN on Temu/Alibaba

### Example:
```
Card Number: 4532 1234 5678 9012
             ^^^^
             This is the BIN

4532 = Visa card issued by specific bank
```

### Why You Can't Just Print Any Number:
1. **BIN must be registered** with Visa/Mastercard
2. **Bank must sponsor** your card program
3. **Processor must route** transactions
4. **Compliance required** (KYC, AML, etc.)
5. **Insurance needed** for fraud protection

### You'll See Listings Like:
- "Programmable magnetic stripe cards"
- "Blank chip cards"
- "Customizable smart cards"

### The Truth:
**These are NOT connected to banking networks!**

They have:
- ✅ Physical chip/stripe

- ❌ Won't work at stores/ATMs
- ❌ Just data storage cards

**Use Cases:**
- Hotel room keys
- Access control cards

3. Cards work at participating merchants only
4. Much cheaper than open-loop

### Cost Comparison:
```
Alibaba cards: $150 (1,000 × $0.15)
Gift card processor setup: $1,500
Monthly platform: $200
Total startup: $1,850

vs.

Open-loop (Visa/MC): $8,000-10,000
```

### Limitations:
- ❌ Won't work everywhere
- ❌ No ATM access
- ❌ Limited merchant acceptance
- ✅ Much cheaper
- ✅ Good for pilot programs
