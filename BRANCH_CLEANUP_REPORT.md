  feat/sentry-monitoring \
  feat/social-media-posting \
  feat/stripe-split-payouts \
  feat/stripe-split-payouts-v2 \

6
```

## Impact Assessment

### Benefits
- ✅ Cleaner repository structure
- ✅ Easier to navigate branches
- ✅ Reduced confusion about active work
- ✅ Faster git operations (fewer refs to check)
- ✅ Clear separation: main + dependency updates only

### No Risk
- ✅ All deleted branches were either merged or superseded
- ✅ Git history preserved (commits still accessible via SHA)
- ✅ Can recover branches if needed: `git push origin <sha>:refs/heads/<branch-name>`

---

## Branch Strategy Going Forward

### Current State
- **main**: Primary branch for all development
- **dependabot/***: Automated dependency updates

### Recommended Workflow
1. Create feature branch from `main`
2. Make changes and commit
3. Push to GitHub
4. Create Pull Request
5. Get review and approval
6. Merge to `main`
7. Delete feature branch immediately after merge

### Branch Naming Convention
- `feat/feature-name` - New features
- `fix/bug-description` - Bug fixes
- `docs/documentation-update` - Documentation
- `chore/maintenance-task` - Maintenance
- `refactor/code-improvement` - Refactoring

## Dependabot Branches - Review Guide

### How to Review Dependabot PRs

1. **Check the PR on GitHub**
   - View: https://github.com/elevateforhumanity/fix2/pulls
   - Look for Dependabot PRs

2. **Review Changes**
   - Check changelog/release notes
   - Look for breaking changes
   - Verify compatibility

3. **Test Locally** (optional)
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout dependabot/npm_and_yarn/jest-30.2.0
   pnpm install
   pnpm test
   pnpm run build
   ```

4. **Merge or Close**
   - If tests pass: Merge the PR
   - If breaking changes: Close and update manually later
   - If not needed: Close the PR

### Current Dependabot Updates

| Package | Current | Update | Priority | Notes |
|---------|---------|--------|----------|-------|
| jest | 29.7.0 | 30.2.0 | Medium | Major version - test carefully |
| jsdom | 23.2.0 | 27.0.1 | Medium | Major version - test carefully |
| rimraf | 5.0.10 | 6.0.1 | Low | Minor utility update |
| rollup-plugin-visualizer | 6.0.3 | 6.0.5 | Low | Patch update - safe |
| @vitejs/plugin-react | 5.1.0 | 5.0.4 | Low | Downgrade? Check if intentional |

**Recommendation**: Review and merge the patch updates first (rollup-plugin-visualizer), then test the major updates (jest, jsdom) in a separate session.

## Historical Context

### Previous Cleanup
According to `AUTOPILOT_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md`:
- **October 28, 2024**: Deleted 55 branches (79 → 24)
- **October 29, 2024**: Deleted 18 branches (24 → 6)
- **Total Reduction**: 73 branches → 6 branches (92% reduction)

### Branch Growth Pattern
The repository had accumulated many feature and fix branches over time. Regular cleanup is recommended to maintain a clean structure.

---

## Maintenance Recommendations

### Weekly
- ✅ Delete merged feature branches immediately after PR merge
- ✅ Review open PRs and close stale ones

### Monthly
- ✅ Review dependabot PRs and merge safe updates
- ✅ Check for abandoned branches (no commits in 30+ days)
- ✅ Verify branch protection rules are active

### Quarterly
- ✅ Audit all branches and delete unused ones
- ✅ Review branch naming conventions
- ✅ Update branch strategy documentation

---

## Recovery Instructions

If you need to recover a deleted branch:

```bash
# Find the commit SHA from GitHub or git reflog
git reflog | grep <branch-name>

# Recreate the branch
git push origin <commit-sha>:refs/heads/<branch-name>
```

**Note**: Deleted branches are still in GitHub's history for ~90 days.

---

## Conclusion

**Status**: ✅ Branch cleanup complete  
**Result**: Clean, maintainable repository structure  
**Remaining Work**: Review 5 dependabot PRs when ready  
**Next Cleanup**: Recommended in 30 days or after major feature merges
