## 1️⃣ STUDENT / LEARNER PORTAL

**🎥 Start on:** https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/lms/dashboard

### Script

"Welcome to the Elevate Connects Student Portal — this is where learners manage everything in one place.

On the dashboard, students see their active courses, upcoming assignments, training hours, and their overall progress.

When they go into 'Courses,' they can jump into their lessons, view modules, complete assignments, and follow structured workforce learning paths.

In 'My Progress,' they get a clean breakdown of what's completed, what's pending, and what's needed for certificate eligibility — perfect for WRG, WIOA, JRI, and other agency requirements.

They can view assignments and grades, message their instructors, check notifications, see their training calendar, and access extra resources at any time.

Everything here was built to feel simple, supportive, and job-focused."

**Duration:** 45-60 seconds  
**Key Pages to Show:**

- `/lms/dashboard`
- `/lms/courses`
- `/lms/progress`

## 2️⃣ WORKFORCE ENROLLMENT (WRG / WIOA / JRI / EmployIndy)

**🎥 Go to:** https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/lms/enroll-workforce

### Script

"One of the biggest differences between Elevate and other LMS platforms is our built-in Workforce Enrollment system.

Students can enroll into WRG, WIOA, JRI, EmployIndy-funded programs right here.

They complete their information, upload required documents, and choose their program — all from inside the portal.

The system connects with their case manager, creates caseload entries, and generates the compliance trail required by workforce partners.

Most LMS systems focus on course content. We focus on education + workforce compliance, because real people need real training that leads to real jobs."

**Duration:** 30-40 seconds  
**Key Pages to Show:**

- `/lms/enroll-workforce`
- Form fields and document upload
- Program selection

---

## 3️⃣ CERTIFICATES + PUBLIC VERIFICATION

**🎥 Go to:** https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/lms/certificates  
**🎥 Then show:** https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/cert/verify/SAMPLE123

### Script

"When a learner completes a program, Elevate automatically issues a verified certificate with a QR code and a unique serial number.

Employers and agencies can check the certificate instantly through our verification page.

This gives credibility, builds trust, and eliminates fraud — something most standard LMS platforms don't offer out of the box.

Our credential system also supports revocations, replacements, and compliance tracking for agencies."

**Duration:** 30-40 seconds  
**Key Pages to Show:**

- `/lms/certificates` - Student view
- `/cert/verify/SAMPLE123` - Public verification
- QR code scanning demo

## 4️⃣ PROGRAM HOLDER PORTAL

**🎥 Go to:** https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/program-holder/dashboard

### Script

"Now let's look at the Program Holder Portal.

This is for partners — barbershops, CNA schools, HVAC shops, construction partners, beauty academies — anybody hosting hands-on training.

Program Holders can track their learners, view their caseload, update attendance and progress, and communicate with Elevate.

This makes collaboration seamless.

They also have access to revenue-share details and training documentation."

**Duration:** 30-40 seconds  
**Key Pages to Show:**

- `/program-holder/dashboard`
- Participant list

## 5️⃣ DIGITAL MOU SIGNING (1/3 Revenue Share)

### Script

"Elevate is one of the only LMS platforms with built-in digital MOU signing for training partners.

Program Holders can review the agreement, sign with their finger or mouse, and submit it instantly.

Once Elevate countersigns from the admin portal, a fully executed PDF is automatically generated and emailed to both sides.

No paperwork. No manual forms.

This keeps every partner compliant before onboarding their students."

**Duration:** 30-40 seconds  
**Key Pages to Show:**

- `/program-holder/mou`
- MOU text
- Signature pad
- Success confirmation

## 6️⃣ DELEGATE / CASE MANAGER PORTAL

**🎥 Go to:** https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/delegate/reports

### Script

"This is the Delegate Portal — designed for case managers, navigators, and workforce staff.

Delegates can monitor learner progress, see completion rates, log case notes, and track engagement.

They can quickly see who is on track, who needs outreach, and who is unresponsive.

This portal is critical for WRG, WIOA, JRI, and EmployIndy partnerships — because it gives workforce organizations the transparency they need."

**Duration:** 30-40 seconds  
**Key Pages to Show:**

- `/delegate/reports`
- Caseload view
- Status indicators (On Track / At Risk / Not Engaged)

## 7️⃣ ADMIN PORTAL

**🎥 Then:** https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/admin/reports  
**🎥 Then:** https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/admin/reports/caseload

### Script

"The Admin Portal is where Elevate really shines.

Admins can approve program holder applications, manage delegates, and generate powerful reports.

The Reports Hub shows completions, enrollment numbers, certificate metrics, and funding program performance.

The Caseload Report breaks down who is active, who's at risk, and who needs support.

Admins can also issue bulk certificates, countersign MOUs, and manage partners.

This is something most LMS systems do not support — a true multi-layer workforce platform built around real program operations."

**Key Pages to Show:**

- `/admin/program-holders`
- `/admin/applications`
- `/admin/reports`

**🎥 Visit:** https://www.elevateforhumanity.org/enroll/sample-program

### Script

"We also offer public enrollment pages for training programs, so learners can join free, funded, or paid courses easily.

And with public certificate verification, employers and agencies instantly confirm credentials.

This makes the entire platform trustworthy and transparent, especially for workforce partners and grant-funded training."

**Duration:** 20-30 seconds  
**Key Pages to Show:**

- `/enroll/sample-program`

## 9️⃣ CLOSING — ELEVATOR PITCH

**🎤 Record as selfie or voiceover**

### Script

"Most LMS platforms like Moodle, Docebo, and LearnWorlds are designed for online courses.

They are great for learning — but not designed for real-world workforce programs.

Elevate Connects was built to manage everything: students, training providers, case managers, workforce programs, reports, compliance, and credentials — all in one place.

If you're training people for careers — not just clicks — Elevate is the platform built for you."

**Duration:** 30 seconds  
**Format:** Talking head or voiceover with platform screenshots
